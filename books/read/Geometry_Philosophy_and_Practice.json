Ancient cultures <b style='color: forestgreen;'>used</b> geometry to understand patterns, while modern science also acknowledges patterns as the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>essence</b> of matter. Our senses like sight, sound, and smell, operate on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>proportional</b> differences, which are basically <b style='color: forestgreen;'>geometric</b> or patterned. Geometry as a discipline lets us explore and understand these <b style='color: forestgreen;'>divine patterns</b>, resonating with both form and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>function</b>. The balance between the feminine and masculine principles in geometric practices bridges the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>abstract</b> with the practical."
