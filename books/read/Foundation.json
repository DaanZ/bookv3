Set in the vast expanse of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Galactic Empire</b>, the story paints a picture of a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>society influenced by Seldon's revolutionary science of \"psychohistory\"</b>, capable of predicting vast trends affecting civilizational destinies. Gaal is excited but naive, experiencing space travel's wonders while oblivious to the looming Empire's political tensions. His arrival sets the stage for a tale of ambition, science, and the decay of imperial power."

The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>real purpose</b> of this plan was to create a civilizing force to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>reduce the period of chaos</b> after the Empire's fall from 30,000 years to just 1,000 years.
