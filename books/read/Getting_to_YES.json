It involves separating people from problems, focusing on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interests</b> instead of positions, and finding options for mutual gain while insisting on using objective criteria. The authors, seasoned negotiators from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Harvard</b>, developed this approach to help individuals negotiate better in various situations, from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>diplomatic talks to personal conflicts</b>.

By applying principled negotiation, agreements become fair and sustainable, making the process efficient and respectful."

Positional bargaining leads to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>coalitions</b> based on symbolic rather than substantive interests, making it difficult to change negotiated positions once they are jointly established. The complexity increases with more people and stakeholders, emphasizing the drawbacks of positional agreements. \n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'><b style='color: forestgreen;'>Dangers of Soft vs. Hard Positional Bargaining</b></h3>\n\nNegotiators often choose between <b style='color: forestgreen;'>soft</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hard</b> bargaining tactics. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Soft bargaining</b> emphasizes getting along and reaching any agreement sometimes at one's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>expense</b>, while <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hard bargaining</b> pushes for favorable outcomes regardless of relationship damage. However, both create issues; soft negotiators are vulnerable to hard ones, leading to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unbalanced agreements</b> that may <b style='color: forestgreen;'>not be wise</b>.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'><b style='color: forestgreen;'>Alternative: Principled Negotiation Method</b></h3>\n\nA better alternative is <b style='color: forestgreen;'>principled negotiation</b>, which detaches people-problems, focuses on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interests</b> rather than positions, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>generates options</b> before deciding, and relies on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>objective criteria</b>. This method allows negotiators to handle relationships effectively while addressing substantive issues, as seen in the Harvard Negotiation Project's four key points: <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Separate people from problems</b>, focus on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interests</b>, invent <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mutual gain options</b>, and use <b style='color: forestgreen;'>objective standards</b>."

The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hard-soft</b> negotiation dilemma highlights how being too <b style='color: forestgreen;'>soft</b> or too <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hard</b> can lead to unfavorable outcomes. The answer is to change the game through <b style='color: forestgreen;'>principled negotiation</b>, which involves focusing on separating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>people</b> from the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>problem</b>, assessing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interests</b> rather than <b style='color: forestgreen;'>positions</b>, generating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>options</b> for mutual gain, and relying on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>objective criteria</b>.\n\nPrincipled negotiation revolves around four main <b style='color: forestgreen;'>points</b>: <b style='color: forestgreen;'>separate</b> the people from the problem, focus on underlying <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interests</b> rather than hardened positions, invent mutual gain <b style='color: forestgreen;'>options</b>, and insist on using objective <b style='color: forestgreen;'>criteria</b>.

Understanding the other party's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>thinking</b> is essential, as conflicts typically arise from differences in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mindset</b> rather than objective realities.
