These neurons respond to visual, attentional, and motor signals not driven solely by either. For example, in a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>saccade task</b>, LIP neurons maintain the memory of a stimulus and respond even if the stimulus is not in view, denoting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>oculocentric remapping</b>.
