In the 1600s, Leeuwenhoek managed to see \"animalcules\" and some bacteria. These microscopes displayed images as virtual and had limitations like specimen positioning and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lens aberrations</b>. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Compound Microscope</b>, developed by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Janssen brothers</b> and Galileo, uses two lenses (objective and eyepiece) for a two-stage magnification process. The image seen through the microscope is not real but a \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>virtual image</b>.\"\n\nIn a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>compound microscope</b>, light passes through a condenser, then the specimen, and is gathered by an objective which, along with a tube lens, projects the image to the eyepiece. It then reaches the observer's eye. The image appears as if it is 10 inches away. Some microscopes, used specifically in tissue cultures, are <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inverted</b>; their functioning principle remains the same as in upright ones, including the setup of illumination. \n\nA general walkthrough of microscope operation is followed by the main components. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Infinity-corrected</b> objective systems are highlighted for certain equipment. These systems ensure precise focus and image quality, essential for accurate microscopy observations. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Microscope setup</b> primarily focuses on achieving flawless specimen view and studying details effectively."

Parallel light passing through a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>convex lens</b> focuses at a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>focal point</b> on the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>focal plane</b>. This is similar to using a \"burning glass\". The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>focal distance</b> is the distance from the center of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>convex lens</b> to the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>focal plane</b>. Different distances of the object from the lens create images that vary in size and orientation. Images can be smaller, same size, or larger than the object, and they are generally <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inverted</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>real</b>. \n\nThe <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Image Formation Process</b> in a microscope involves different <b style='color: forestgreen;'>scenarios</b> or \"Cases\". In <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Case 4</b>, the object is between one and two focal lengths; the image is real, inverted, and magnified, relevant for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>microscopy objectives</b>. In <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Case 5</b>, when the object is at the front focal plane of a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>convex lens</b>, the rays emerge parallel, creating an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>upright virtual image</b>. This is like a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>magnifying glass</b>, crucial for understanding the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>eyepiece</b> function.\n\nFor <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Infinity-Corrected Objectives</b>, the object is positioned at the front focal plane, making <b style='color: forestgreen;'>light rays</b> emerge parallel. A <b style='color: forestgreen;'>tube lens</b> in the microscope then focuses these rays back to the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>eyepiece</b>. This design allows for variance in observation and imaging without altering the lens itself.
