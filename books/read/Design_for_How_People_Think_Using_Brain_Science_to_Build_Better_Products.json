            "body": "The preface introduces why the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>author</b> wrote this book, emphasizing the application of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>psychology</b> in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>product design</b>. Many people are surprised that a psychologist can contribute to this field, often asking if they're being analyzed. The book provides a path for designing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>great experiences</b> by combining various <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cognitive processes</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>senses</b>. It highlights that people aren't always aware of their own mental processes, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>recognizing colors</b> without conscious awareness. The author, trained in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cognitive science</b>, shares insights to improve products, aiming to help <b style='color: forestgreen;'>product managers</b> and designers identify these cognitive aspects and use <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interviews</b> to enhance the design process, ensuring products meet the audience's needs effectively. This hands-on, practical guide is meant for professionals eager to create exceptional, memorable experiences. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Six Minds framework</b> outlined aims to better understand and segment audience needs for successful product development."

The goal is to have a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>psychologically driven design</b> process and integrate what we know about our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>minds</b> into product design. The author encourages feedback from psychologists and cognitive scientists to refine his approach."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Memory</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>perception</b> often work in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>abstract</b> ways rather than detailed ones. People use <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stereotypes</b>, conceptual <b style='color: forestgreen;'>memories</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mental models</b> to quickly process visual scenes and interactions. For example, when asked to distinguish a US penny from similar images, most people struggle because their memory doesn't store all the specific details of the coin; it stores a general <b style='color: forestgreen;'>concept</b> of it. The chapter also discusses the phenomenon of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>boundary extension</b>, where the mind fills in gaps beyond the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>edges</b> of a scene based on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>assumptions</b>. This cognitive tendency can be applied positively in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>product</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>service design</b> by creating experiences that align with users' <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stereotypes</b> and expectations\u2014leading to a more intuitive and trustworthy interaction without needing thorough instructions or explanations."

Language helps us understand how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>audiences</b> perceive our products. But words can have different meanings for different people. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Laypeople</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>experts</b> might use different terms, like in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>healthcare</b> jargon. This impacts product <b style='color: forestgreen;'>trust</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>experience</b>.\n\nCommunication can fail when overusing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>jargon</b> or misaligning with consumer <b style='color: forestgreen;'>understanding</b>. This applies to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>texting</b> habits, where terms vary by culture or age. Designers should ensure people feel like 'you're speaking my language' to create comfort. Notably, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>translations</b> can alter meanings in different regions, like a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Chesterfield</b> in Canada is a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>couch</b> in the US. Interviews help identify the exact terms clients use, bridging the experience divide."

Unlike traditional focus groups and surveys, contextual interviews help reveal <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unconscious actions</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nuances</b> in customer behavior, allowing for a deep understanding needed for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>successful product design</b>. By observing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>superusers</b> and the environments where users live, researchers can gather critical insights into <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inefficiencies</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>innovations</b> that are often overlooked.

In product design, it is crucial to incorporate virtual <b style='color: forestgreen;'>signposts</b> or cues to help users orient themselves and know their path within a system. Understanding users\u2019 expectations and how they fill in gaps in their navigation is vital.\n\nIn terms of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>navigation strategies</b>, users may rely on external tools like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>search engines</b> for assistance. When designing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>products or services</b>, it is important to consider the entire ecosystem and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>non-obvious</b> pathways users might take based on their past experiences or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>assumptions</b>.

Understanding these dimensions helps design products that cater to immediate reactions as well as long-term desires and anxieties.
