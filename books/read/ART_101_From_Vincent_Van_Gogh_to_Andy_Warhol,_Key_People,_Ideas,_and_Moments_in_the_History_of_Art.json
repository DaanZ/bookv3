Medieval artists sometimes varied <b style='color: forestgreen;'>figure sizes</b> illogically, depicting humans as both larger and smaller than buildings they stood near.

The use of perspective enabled artists from the Renaissance onwards to create more evocative scenes. Intriguingly, ancient methods sometimes reversed today\u2019s practice by making distant objects appear <b style='color: forestgreen;'>larger</b> than those closer."
