            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Many argue</b> that modern humans are beyond <b style='color: forestgreen;'>evolution by natural selection</b>. Though we manipulate environments to fit our biology, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>evolution</b> continues subtly through societal and psychological pressures. Variation between individuals persists, driving change over time. While we might not quickly evolve into a new species, our genetics have shifted from 300,000 years ago, such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>diversified skin color.</b> Human evolution is slow; species shifts typically span <b style='color: forestgreen;'>a million years.</b>\n\nSome evolutionary changes are noticeable in modern humans, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lactase persistence</b>. Mammals generally stop producing lactase after weaning, leading to lactose intolerance in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>two-thirds</b> of adults consuming milk, causing digestion issues. Yet, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>one-third</b> of humans continue to produce lactase, aiding in their ability to digest milk. This persistence reveals evolutionary adaptation in humans to dairy consumption.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Lactase persistence</b> allows some humans to digest lactose beyond infancy, whereas many adults experience discomfort with milk. This trait shows modern evolutionary change, highlighting that although evolution may be subtle, it remains impactful over time. Lactase persistence is an advantage for those populations that historically relied on dairy, shaping dietary practices and health outcomes."

            "body": "In a remarkable <b style='color: forestgreen;'>study on domestication</b> by Dmitri Belyaev in 1959, silver foxes were selectively bred for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>tameness</b> at a farm in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Despite initial challenges during a politically risky time in the Soviet Union, the experiment thrived under Belyaev and his assistant Lyudmila Trut. Over generations, these foxes became more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sociable</b> and physically changed, suggesting domestication causes both <b style='color: forestgreen;'>behavioral</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>physical transformations</b>. This mirrors what may have occurred in human <b style='color: forestgreen;'>evolution</b>, where skull and social trait changes indicate that humans might have domesticated themselves, reflecting a similar selective <b style='color: forestgreen;'>advantage</b>.\n\nAnother breakthrough idea <b style='color: forestgreen;'>links domestication</b> to neural crest cells, vital during early human development. These cells contribute to various body structures and may influence traits associated with domestication, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>reduced aggression</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>physical features</b>. The drastic alteration in foxes' features during the domestication study aligns with this hypothesis, hinting that fewer neural crest cells might drive these changes. Although still a hypothesis, understanding this can shed light on why humans became highly <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sociable</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>less aggressive</b>.\n\nThe complexity of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>skin colour</b> evolution is another captivating subject. Modern genetic analysis reveals that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dark skin</b> evolved over a million years ago, prior to humans. However, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>light skin</b> adaptation in Europeans appeared about <b style='color: forestgreen;'>6,000 years ago</b>, suggesting a separate, later development. Interestingly, different genetic paths led to lighter skin in East Asians, showing that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>evolutionary pressures</b> differed globally. Although the exact reasons behind these adaptations remain debated, our understanding continues to grow, illuminating how complicated and intertwined our biological evolution truly is."

Folate is vital for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>DNA repair</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cell division</b>, with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>UV light</b> causing folate breakdown, leading to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>darker skin</b> evolution for protection. Conversely, vitamin D synthesis requires sunlight, so <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lighter skin</b> appeared in areas with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>less UV exposure</b> to boost vitamin D production. An <b style='color: forestgreen;'>alternative theory</b> proposes that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>skin melanin</b> evolved to manage <b style='color: forestgreen;'>water conservation</b> through less permeability, becoming unnecessary in Europe.

In 2013, a survey found that 7% of South Koreans between the ages of five and fifty-five were at risk of becoming addicted to the internet. Among <b style='color: forestgreen;'>teenagers</b>, this figure was even more alarming, with one in eight at risk. This growing concern has led South Korea to actively seek ways to understand and address the issue to prevent potential addiction.\n\n## Understanding Addiction: Beyond Drugs\n\nTraditionally, addiction was associated with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>substances</b> like cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. These substances alter brain chemistry, creating a dependency and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. However, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>research</b> has shown that addiction is not only about substances; it\u2019s about behaviors too, with activities that cause dopamine spikes being potentially addictive. An experiment by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Kent Berridge</b> with rats demonstrated that wanting and liking are distinct, shedding light on why behavioral addictions like internet use can develop.\n\n## The Role of Dopamine in Internet and Game Addiction\n\nDopamine is a key player in addiction, regulating our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>wants</b> more than our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>likes</b>. Video games, like the infamous <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Flappy Bird</b>, showcase how simple games can become addictive by providing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>simple goals</b> that seem achievable. The game's mechanics encourage repetitive playing despite players not necessarily enjoying it. This reinforces understanding of behavioral addiction, a concern as more interactive online activities continue to emerge globally, prompting nations like South Korea to explore solutions tailored for such widespread phenomena."

Initially assumed to be caused by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>beta-amyloid plaques</b>, researchers suggested they obstruct brain function. Despite massive investments, efforts to treat or understand Alzheimer's based solely on this <b style='color: forestgreen;'>amyloid hypothesis</b> have been disappointing.

While the bacteria in brains of test mice produce <b style='color: forestgreen;'>amyloid plaques</b>, the exact pathway of how these bacteria reach the brain remains unclear. Some hypotheses include <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sneaking through white blood cells</b>.

Some theories suggest that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sexual selection</b> could be linked to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hairy</b> men being seen as more desirable. However, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>parasites</b> like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>head lice</b> on hair or the need for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>heat regulation</b> in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>African climate</b> might have driven this change. Less hair could lead to fewer <b style='color: forestgreen;'>parasites</b> or improve <b style='color: forestgreen;'>body temperature control</b>, especially with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>velus hairs</b> aiding in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cooling</b>.\n\nDespite these theories, other primates didn't evolve similarly, causing scientists to ponder why humans did. While less hair helps in heat regulation, a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fur covering</b> is beneficial for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>warmth at night</b>.

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Queue Theory</b> is a branch of mathematics focused on optimal line management, originating with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Agner Erlang</b> in 1909. The basic categorization of queues uses a code of two letters and a number, defining arrival frequency, service time, and server count (e.g., D/D/1 for deterministic arrivals and service with 1 server). While the simplest <b style='color: forestgreen;'>D/D/1</b> queue rarely occurs with humans, a more common <b style='color: forestgreen;'>M/M/1</b> queue features random arrivals and service times, like in supermarkets where line delays can occur unpredictably. \n\nSuch random <b style='color: forestgreen;'>M/M/1 queues</b> manifest not only in supermarkets but also in other scenarios like public lavatories, where women's wait times are disproportionately longer due to a mismatch in facility numbers and usage time. Even increasing facilities doesn't guarantee equal waiting times, as designs often don't account for holistic seat allocation principles. Inequity persists despite efforts to adjust architectural designs based on rigorous queue mathematics.\n\nSolutions for efficient queuing, drawing from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>M/M/1 principles</b>, recommend adjusting facilities in women's restrooms to match load demands. Doubling women's facilities relative to men's is optimal, but it requires balancing spatial allocation disparities. Toilets take more space than urinals, complicating implementation.
