Roitblat discusses the complexities and challenges associated with achieving <b style='color: forestgreen;'>general artificial intelligence</b> (AI). Despite significant advances in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>specialized applications</b> of AI, like playing chess or diagnosing diseases, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>general intelligence</b> akin to human intelligence remains elusive. The author argues that evolving human intelligence has historically involved the creation of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>artificial tools</b> like language and mathematics. Similarly, to achieve general AI, new tools or methods must be developed since current <b style='color: forestgreen;'>algorithms are insufficient</b>. The fear of AI surpassing human intelligence leading to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>catastrophic scenarios</b>, while popular in media, is not grounded in current technological capabilities."

            "body": "Human intelligence is a complex and multi-faceted capability. While traditional intelligence tests measure skills like reasoning, abstract thinking, and problem-solving, these tests don't fully capture the richness of human thought. Furthermore, the correlation between intelligence test scores and problem-solving ability isn't as strong as one might expect. For instance, while humans excel at problem-solving, this skill doesn't always align directly with intelligence test scores because solving real-world problems often requires insights that aren't measured by these tests.\n\nPractical problem-solving involves a blend of systematic thinking and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intuitive insights</b>, or what some psychologists refer to as \"insight problems.\" These are challenges that are typically solved not by step-by-step reasoning but through a sudden shift in understanding or perception. Insight problems can highlight the need for a different representation of information or an innovative approach to finding a solution, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lacking a predictable path</b> to follow.\n\nThe focus in computational intelligence has primarily been on well-defined path problems\u2014those with defined steps and clear goals like playing chess. However, real-world intelligence requires solving less structured, nuanced problems, which often involves integrating insights gained from experiences and employing heuristics. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Computers excel at structure and logic</b>, but humans bring to the table the unpredictability of thought born from personal experience and intuition\u2014a critical aspect yet to be mastered by AI."

It's emphasized that while computers follow predefined paths for problem solving, humans frequently demonstrate insight into problem-solving, gaining <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"aha\" moments</b>, overcoming obstacles not through systematic steps but through <b style='color: forestgreen;'>restructuring or new representations</b>. The text delves into how humans don't always behave in systematic, logical processes, and how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>heuristics</b> such as the \"availability heuristic\" can lead to quick decisions but are not always accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Insight problems differ from formal, well-structured problems. Usually, insight problems require rethinking or representing problems differently, leading to rapid understanding and problem resolution. Examples include the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Archimedes' story of the crown</b> and the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>socks problem</b>, highlighting how people sometimes need to break from usual representations, which may lead to easier problem solving. Despite human inefficiencies such as errors in rational decision-making, these insights are significant.</p>\n\n<p>Computer solutions have focused more on formal problems, whereas insight problems represent challenges not yet broadly tackled by machines. Traditional AI has been modeled primarily on formal reasoning, assumptions of logic and explicit calculation, often failing to capture the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>randomness of human thought</b>. While <b style='color: forestgreen;'>computers calculate paths</b> using formality and logical systems, it's noted that humans leverage broad thinking and emotional cognition, especially when living with ambiguities, showcasing distinct differences.</p>"
