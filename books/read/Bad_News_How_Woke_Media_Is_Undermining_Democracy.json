This discussion reflects a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>moral panic</b> on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>race</b> that has spread from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>academics</b> to the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mainstream media</b>, painting the US as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>systemically racist</b>.

This tone contributed to how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>liberal media</b> disregarded the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>working class</b>, while conservative outlets catered to them, albeit with their own biases. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>economic struggles</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cultural concerns</b> of the working class, who value family and faith over resumes, were overlooked. A journalism that addresses this <b style='color: forestgreen;'>class divide</b>, rather than hiding it, is crucial for a functioning democracy. Instead, today's press often sides with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>powerful elites</b> rather than holding them accountable, worsening <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inequality</b> and undermining democracy."

The Times gained many readers from respectable families and emphasized <b style='color: forestgreen;'>civility</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dignity</b>, despite Raymond personally opposing laws like the Fugitive Slave Act and keeping his editorial page weak to maintain neutrality. This reflected a preference for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>conservative societal views</b> and respectability over broader populist appeal, paving the way for a specific upper-middle-class readership.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Adolph Ochs</b> bought the Times in 1896 and maintained its <b style='color: forestgreen;'>respectability</b> while appealing to the social elite, though being Jewish posed a social barrier. He focused the paper\u2019s content on business and international news, avoiding scandal and tailoring it to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>affluent</b> New Yorkers.
