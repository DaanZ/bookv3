Many <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dot-coms</b> failed, and Netflix was suddenly unable to raise needed <b style='color: forestgreen;'>funds</b>. Morale was low, and it led Reed Hastings, Marc Randolph, and Patty McCord to make tough decisions. They decided to keep only the top <b style='color: forestgreen;'>performing</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creative</b> <b style='color: forestgreen;'>employees</b>, letting go of those who weren't contributing at high levels, even if they were friends or hard workers. Despite fears of backlash, focusing on a high-density team of stunning colleagues would later show its value in handling challenges and evolving Netflix's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>culture</b> into one that thrives on freedom and responsibility."

Despite losing a third of the workforce, the remaining employees exhibited increased <b style='color: forestgreen;'>passion and energy</b>. Unexpectedly, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>morale improved</b>, and by early 2002, the company's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>DVD-by-mail subscription business</b> was growing rapidly again. It was amazing that 80 employees, with high <b style='color: forestgreen;'>spirits</b>, accomplished more work than before.\n\nThe reason behind this improvement lay in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"talent density\"</b>. With fewer employees, the workforce comprised largely talented individuals, which increased the overall <b style='color: forestgreen;'>talent per employee</b>. This created an environment that was <b style='color: forestgreen;'>more effective</b> and led to employees being happier. At Netflix, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>top performers</b> thrive best when surrounded by other talented and collaborative individuals.\n\nThe company learned that having a few inadequate performers can diminish a team's overall performance. In contrast, high <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"talent density\"</b> encourages <b style='color: forestgreen;'>better productivity</b> and stimulates others to perform excellently. Hence, a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>great workplace</b> is about having talented, collaborative team members, which results in a performance that spirals upward."

The importance of having a team full of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stunning colleagues</b> became apparent, as it encouraged an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>exciting and inspiring</b> work atmosphere.

Her initial frankness with the CEO, Reed, resulted in her getting hired, and marked the start of an enduring friendship. Both Reed and Patty analyzed why post-layoff morale was high, concluding that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>high talent density</b> played a key role. Simply having the best <b style='color: forestgreen;'>talent per employee</b> boosted motivation and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>satisfactory team interactions</b>.\n\nWhen there are just <b style='color: forestgreen;'>adequate performers</b>, they can lower the overall <b style='color: forestgreen;'>energy and effectiveness</b> of a team.
