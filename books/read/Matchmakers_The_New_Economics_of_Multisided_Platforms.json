This model deviates from traditional firms' economics: it focuses on bringing customer groups together instead of selling products. Examples include tech giants like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Apple</b> and startups like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Airbnb</b>. The book reveals how this business model uses platforms to <em style='color: forestgreen;'>reduce friction</em> and facilitate transactions, requiring new strategies distinct from conventional methods."

The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Financial Times</b> example illustrates how pricing influences both <b style='color: forestgreen;'>readership</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>advertising revenue</b>, showcasing the complexity of managing such platforms.
