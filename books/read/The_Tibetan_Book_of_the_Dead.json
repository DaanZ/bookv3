During the practice, a strong <b style='color: forestgreen;'>visualization</b> of deities like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Vajrasattva</b> occurs, usually seen as translucent and adorned with symbolic objects\u2014weapons and jewels representing spiritual qualities. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mantras</b> you chant purify the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>conceptual obscurations</b> believed to lead to suffering.\n\nIn the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Purification</b> part, you visualize <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Vajrasattva</b> with a healing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nectar</b> pouring from his heart, cleansing all impurities.
