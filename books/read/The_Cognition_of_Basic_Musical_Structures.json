These ideas stem from the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Gestalt school</b> in the 1920s, focusing on perception both visually and auditorily. Similarity groups things that are alike, while proximity groups things close together. Psychological studies on musical grouping find it more challenging to determine \"correct\" analysis compared to meter, due to music's ambiguity.

The challenge lies in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>identifying these lines</b>, which may not always be distinctly separated, as they can start and stop, overlap, or merge at times. This process, termed <b style='color: forestgreen;'>contrapuntal analysis</b>, is key in understanding complex compositions like Mozart\u2019s Sonata K. 332. In contrapuntal music, a voice is bounded by time and pitch rather than being continuous throughout a piece. Unlike polyphonic pieces, where distinct voices or lines are easily recognizable, contrapuntal compositions require listeners to perceive separate melodic lines from a stream of sound. \n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Sequential Integration in Auditory Psychology</b>\n\nPitch proximity is a crucial element of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sequential integration</b>, the process involved in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stream segregation</b>\u2014analyzing and segmenting sound input into coherent units. When there is a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>pitch proximity</b>, notes are easier to group into a single line and recognize.
