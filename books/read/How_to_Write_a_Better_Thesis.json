It is defined as an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>extended argument</b>, showcasing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>structured and logical reasoning</b> backed by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>credible evidence</b>. A thesis needs to make an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>original contribution</b> to knowledge, as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>judged by experts</b>. Given its unique nature, each thesis is different, and usually, only a select group of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>supervisors and specialized academics</b> reads it thoroughly. Early on, it's beneficial to understand what a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>thesis aims to accomplish</b> and what <b style='color: forestgreen;'>examiners look for</b> to judge its merit. The university guidelines, which are often accessible online, describe key <b style='color: forestgreen;'>attributes of a successful thesis</b>, such as demonstrating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>authority and command of knowledge</b> in relevant fields."

A <b style='color: forestgreen;'>thesis</b> should not be a series of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>random</b> notes but a well-structured document that guides the reader from the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>aim</b> to the conclusion. Thus, structuring your thesis is crucial to ensure readers understand your <b style='color: forestgreen;'>findings</b> effectively."
