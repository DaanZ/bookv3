While they may lack consultative sale skills initially, building a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-learning sales organization</b> helps them learn these skills <b style='color: forestgreen;'>quickly</b>. Their inclination towards <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sharing knowledge</b> and the potential to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>learn on the job</b> is beneficial, especially as learning is integrated into daily operations.

To capture potential clients, it's important to excel in all channels, whether it be through <b style='color: forestgreen;'>content marketing</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>SEO</b>, or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social media</b> interactions. The goal is to ensure clients are <b style='color: forestgreen;'>aware</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>educated</b> early on, leading to them becoming a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)</b>.

Yet, as the cost of changing vendors has dropped, LTV\u2019s relevance has diminished.
