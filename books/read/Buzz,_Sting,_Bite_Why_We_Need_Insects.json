Meanwhile, species like the Southern green <b style='color: forestgreen;'>shieldbug</b> can mate for ten days, while Indian stick insects can extend this to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>79</b> days."

Up to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>6,000 species</b> inhabit dead wood in Nordic forests, including <b style='color: forestgreen;'>3,000 insects</b>! This stage of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>decomposition</b> is crucial. Fungi and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bacteria</b> enrich the timber's nutrients, making it more appetizing for insects. Consequently, these organisms break down cellulose and lignin, major wood components, to boost nutrient availability. Intriguingly, there are more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>living cells</b> in a dead tree than when it was alive, supporting biodiversity. Each species has <b style='color: forestgreen;'>specific preferences</b> and roles, coexisting harmoniously within these decaying havens. \n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Variety in Habitat:</b> Different <b style='color: forestgreen;'>insects</b> have unique demands for the type of wood they inhabit. For them, a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dead spruce</b> varies vastly from a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dead birch</b>. Even the same species of tree can provide different habitats based on its <b style='color: forestgreen;'>decomposition stage</b>. This complexity is tough for humans to appreciate but vital for insects. A decaying <b style='color: forestgreen;'>oak branch</b> offers a completely different environment than a large rotting oak trunk. Additionally, insects need convenient access across the forest to find suitable wood to colonize, especially in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>natural forests</b> with richer <b style='color: forestgreen;'>variety</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>abundance</b> of dead wood than modern managed ones."
