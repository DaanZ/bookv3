Geoffrey Miller uses this metaphor to explore human <b style='color: forestgreen;'>evolution</b>. He argues that human intelligence and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creativity</b> evolved not just for survival, but as courtship tools used to attract mates. Unlike natural selection which favors <b style='color: forestgreen;'>survival</b>, Miller discusses sexual selection for reproduction, suggesting our minds are like the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>peacock's tail</b>\u2014attractive displays shaped by mate selection. This explains our unique development of language, art, and morality. The theory shifts the focus from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>survivalist views</b> to a \"courtship-centered\" view, bringing clarity to our mental abilities."

Darwin proposed that these traits evolved because of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mate choice</b>, usually <b style='color: forestgreen;'>female choice</b>, favoring <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ornamentation</b> that signals health and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fitness</b>. He suggested two processes: <b style='color: forestgreen;'>competition among males</b> for mates and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>female selection</b> among males. This idea was <b style='color: forestgreen;'>revolutionary</b> as it attributed the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>shaping of animal evolution</b> partly to the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>preferences</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>psychology</b> of animals themselves.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Ronald Fisher</b> later contributed to sexual selection theory by formalizing explanations for sexual preferences. Fisher proposed the concept of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fitness indicators</b>, where <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ornaments</b> signal an animal's health and vigor, and the concept of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>runaway sexual selection</b>, which involves <b style='color: forestgreen;'>positive-feedback loops</b> between sexual preferences and ornaments leading to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>extreme trait evolution</b>. Fisher argued that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>preferences and ornaments</b> evolve together, with each generation favoring more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>exaggerated traits</b>.\n\nHowever, the theory faced <b style='color: forestgreen;'>skepticism</b> and was sidelined by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>prominent critics</b> such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Julian Huxley</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Alfred Wallace</b>, who dismissed sexual selection's effects on evolution. This rejection stemmed from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>societal biases</b>, lack of mathematical models, and the belief that evolution focused solely on traits related to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>survival</b> rather than <b style='color: forestgreen;'>reproduction</b>. Interest in sexual selection resurfaced only after the re-publication of Fisher's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Genetical Theory</b> and modern scientists like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>John Maynard Smith</b> began to explore its impact more rigorously."
