            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Globalization</b> has been an essential aspect of human history, evolving through seven distinct <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ages</b>. Each age showcases the interplay of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>geography</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>technology</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>institutions</b>. This journey began with humanity's migration in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Paleolithic Age</b>, advancing to the agricultural growth of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Neolithic Age</b>. The domestication of the horse marked the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Equestrian Age</b>, fostering long-distance trade. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Classical Age</b> introduced large empires and trans-Eurasian interactions. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Ocean Age</b> expanded territories across oceans, while the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Industrial Age</b> accelerated technological advancements. Today, the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Digital Age</b> challenges us with global interconnectedness through technology. The book emphasizes understanding these transitions to navigate future global changes wisely. This understanding is crucial now more than ever as we face contemporary challenges."

Initial societal activities were <b style='color: forestgreen;'>primary sector-focused</b> (agriculture and mining), but modern advances shifted employment <b style='color: forestgreen;'>towards services</b>.
