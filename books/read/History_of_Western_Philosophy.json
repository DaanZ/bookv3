Although not as renowned as figures like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Pythagoras</b>, he was pivotal in shaping Athenian <b style='color: forestgreen;'>philosophy</b>, especially with his idea that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mind</b> is a primary cause of physical changes. Anaxagoras spent thirty years in Athens, likely invited by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Pericles</b> to help cultivate intellectual life. He inspired many, including, possibly, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Euripides</b>. Unfortunately, Anaxagoras faced persecution due to claims against his religious views and cosmological ideas, such as describing the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sun</b> as a red-hot stone. Despite this, his legacy persisted, marking a key step in the evolution of Greek thought."

Only philosophers, or those who <b style='color: forestgreen;'>love wisdom</b>, can access true <b style='color: forestgreen;'>knowledge</b>, which perceives eternal and immutable aspects of reality, unlike opinion which deals with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sensible</b> and changeable <b style='color: forestgreen;'>objects</b>. This leads to the theory of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ideas</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>forms</b>, where general concepts represent <b style='color: forestgreen;'>eternal truths</b> as opposed to the particular things perceived by the senses. The dialogue also highlights education for becoming a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>philosopher</b>, emphasizing a rigorous intellectual training encompassing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>arithmetic and geometry</b>.\n\nThe dialogue likens the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>philosophical journey</b> to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ascending from a cave</b>, moving from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>shadows</b> to the light of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sun</b>, representing truth and goodness. Despite the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>logical beauty</b> of this metaphor, Plato's reliance on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>infallible rationalism</b> over <b style='color: forestgreen;'>empirical evidence</b>, as seen in his form-based definitions, shows a divide between <b style='color: forestgreen;'>appearance and reality</b>. Critiques suggest his views do not align with empirical methods but highlight the difficulty of separating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>universal concepts</b> from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>particular objects</b> in philosophical discussion."

These ideas encouraged enduring hardship while maintaining virtue, influenced by their deterministic universe view where everything was fated to repeat. \n\nHowever, such a worldview faced logical issues due to contradictions between free will and determinism\u2014the Stoic belief that one could be free if their will aligned with nature, despite the world\u2019s deterministic nature. This point was also marked by tension regarding benevolence, since they held that individual will is what matters, reducing the impact of external good or harm. Yet, Stoic ideas became widely influential, especially concerning 'natural law' and 'natural rights', emphasizing equality among all humans. This concept became important later during the legal evolution in Europe and influencing principles of modern democracy and justice."
