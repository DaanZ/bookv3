The design involves utilizing WebSocket for real-time servers, complemented by libraries like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Nest.js</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ioredis</b>. The components are layered: <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Kafka</b> for message brokering, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Redis</b> for caching server instance information, and a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>TracedInterceptor</b> for tracking requests. This architecture hinges on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>TypeScript</b> interfaces, which ensure robust type-checking and efficient error handling via reusable <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interceptors</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>filters</b> like the `GraphQlRequestTracer` for monitoring requests."

            "title": "Database Security and Normalization Principles",
            "body": "To ensure secure and reliable interaction with databases, it's crucial to validate client-supplied data before using it in SQL queries. Ensure column names are valid by escaping them with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>escapeId</b>, and verify sorting directions using a function like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>validateSortDirection</b>. When handling LIMIT clauses, confirm the client's values as integers within a range using functions like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>validateRowOffset</b>. Additionally, when processing lists of column names from clients, validate each one to prevent SQL injection. A structured approach to database design can enhance system integrity, as detailed in concepts like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>first, second, and third normal forms</b>. These forms help maintain data consistency by enforcing rules on data dependencies and avoiding redundancy. For instance, ensure a table only contains single values (1NF), all columns depend on the primary key (2NF), and non-key columns are independent (3NF). Document databases, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>MongoDB</b>, offer an alternative for storing complex, hierarchical data structures as JSON objects, enabling complete documents to be efficiently stored and retrieved."

Assigning responsibility for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>microservices</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>microlibraries</b> to single developers maximizes efficiency. In cases where a microservice is large, dividing it into subdomains assigned to individual developers can help.
