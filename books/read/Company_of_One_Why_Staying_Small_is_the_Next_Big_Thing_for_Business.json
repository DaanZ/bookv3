Through personal stories, like that of *Tom Fishburne*, who left a corporate job to pursue cartooning, Jarvis illustrates how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>success doesn't always mean expansion</b>. By working as a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>small, efficient business</b>, individuals can maintain <b style='color: forestgreen;'>autonomy, enjoy work-life balance</b>, and avoid the usual stress of running large companies. This approach encourages people to focus on being <b style='color: forestgreen;'>better</b>, not bigger, challenging conventional beliefs about business success."
