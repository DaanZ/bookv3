            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Wittgenstein's Picture Theory</b>: Wittgenstein was <b style='color: forestgreen;'>deeply troubled</b> by questions of meaning and logic. In his work, the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</b>, he developed the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"picture theory\"</b> of meaning. It emphasized that language succeeds in representing facts by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>picturing them</b>. He likened representing facts through language to arranging <b style='color: forestgreen;'>toy cars in the positions of real cars in an accident</b>. He believed that each <b style='color: forestgreen;'>meaningful sentence</b> could be translated into an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ideal language</b>. This ideal language would be composed of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>simple propositions</b>, such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>the words \"or,\" \"and,\" and \"not.\"</b> This work was influential in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>20th-century philosophy</b>."
