Harlow conducted a groundbreaking but overlooked study on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rhesus monkeys</b>. Harlow offered them puzzles without <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rewards</b> like food or affection, yet they solved them with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>enthusiasm</b>. This behavior suggested a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>third drive</b>\u2014intrinsic motivation, a joy in the task itself. Decades later, Edward Deci's experiments with participants confirmed Harlow's findings, revealing intrinsic motivation's power, especially compared to external rewards like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>money</b>. This led to new insights questioning our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>understanding</b> of motivation, emphasizing the need to rethink approaches in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>business</b> and education."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Summary Chunk:</b>\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Economists Wrong About Motivation</b>: Economists predicted in 1995 that Microsoft's paid expert-led encyclopedia would trump the free, volunteer-contributed Wikipedia. In <b style='color: forestgreen;'>2009, Microsoft shut down Encarta</b> while Wikipedia became the world's largest encyclopedia. Despite <b style='color: forestgreen;'>expectations based on financial incentives</b>, volunteers created successful open-source platforms like Wikipedia and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Firefox</b>. This challenges the traditional view that people work only for money.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Shift from Old Motivational Models</b>: Historically, societies relied on a Motivation 2.0 model based on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"carrots and sticks,\"</b> rewarding good behavior and punishing bad to drive performance. However, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>complexity and creativity</b>, not routine tasks, define today's economy. Most of our economic theory was based on the assumption that humans <b style='color: forestgreen;'>maximize wealth</b> and behave <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rationally</b>. Behavioral economics, pioneered by figures like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Daniel Kahneman</b>, shows humans act on a blend of economic and more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>transcendental</b> motivations.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Creativity and Intrinsic Motivation</b>: Modern work increasingly involves <b style='color: forestgreen;'>heuristic tasks,</b> those requiring new solutions rather than following set rules. Teresa Amabile's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Intrinsic Motivation Principle</b> suggests that creativity thrives not on extrinsic rewards but on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>internal motivation.</b> In a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>flattening organizational world</b>, where jobs are more diverse and people often work remotely, old <b style='color: forestgreen;'>extrinsic incentive models</b> fail. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>New business structures</b>, such as L3Cs and social businesses, focus on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>purpose</b> beyond profit. This <b style='color: forestgreen;'>restructuring</b> indicates a shift towards needing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-directed, inherently motivated people.</b>"

This approach, dubbed the \"carrot and stick\" method, suggested that paying people more for their work would lead to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>improved performance</b>. The success of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Microsoft's Encarta</b> under this system was not uncommon in earlier times when many tasks were <b style='color: forestgreen;'>algorithmic</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>routine</b>. However, the abrupt success of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Wikipedia</b>, an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>open-source model</b> driven by intrinsic motivation, challenged this traditional viewpoint.\n\nThis <b style='color: forestgreen;'>success</b> was just one example of the flaws in Motivation <b style='color: forestgreen;'>2.0</b>. Humans are complex and not purely <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rational</b>, which behavioral economics reveals. We often act out of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>emotion</b> and intrinsic factors rather than <b style='color: forestgreen;'>financial gain</b>. Moreover, many modern jobs have grown <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creative</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-directed</b>, making the traditional carrot-and-stick approach less effective. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Intrinsic rewards</b>, like the satisfaction of solving a problem or mastering a skill, often prove more motivating.\n\nAs such, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Motivation 2.0</b> falls short in today's world where tasks require <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creativity</b>, leaders need people who are <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-motivated</b> rather than dependent on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>external incentives</b>, and where new <b style='color: forestgreen;'>business models</b> shirk traditional organizational structures. Recognizing this challenge encourages a shift towards a new motivation system, one that accounts for people's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inherent human desires</b> for creativity, purpose, and autonomy."

This is evident in many settings, from puzzles to office tasks, revealing strange outcomes that are counter to what we'd expect, much like in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>quantum mechanics.</b>\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>*Baseline rewards</b>* like salary ensure basic needs are met, preventing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>anxiety</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>distrust</b>. But beyond that, using <b style='color: forestgreen;'>carrots and sticks</b> can decrease motivation. Acts of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creativity</b> can be stifled, and attempts to promote positive actions might make them vanish. Instead of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>reducing</b> undesirable behavior, sometimes, they promote it, risking <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cheating</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>short-sightedness</b>.\n\nResearch like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Deci's Soma experiment</b> illustrates that expected rewards can lead to getting less of what we want.

In some situations, concentrating solely on the immediate is understandable, but over time, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>this fixation can be damaging</b>. For instance, in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>big companies</b>, the obsession with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>quarterly earnings</b> can lead to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>short-sighted decisions</b> that harm long-term innovation and growth. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Short-term rewards</b> often <b style='color: forestgreen;'>outweigh long-term costs</b>, potentially leading to unethical behaviors or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>addictive patterns</b> seen in models like economic bubbles.\n\nIn contrast, there are circumstances where <b style='color: forestgreen;'>extrinsic motivators</b> can be beneficial. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Routine tasks</b> that require following a set of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>specific instructions</b> can be enhanced by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>small rewards</b> since they don\u2019t harm <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creativity</b>. Take, for instance, a managerial context where a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dull task</b>, like preparing mail, requires some <b style='color: forestgreen;'>extra nudge</b> for completion. Here, offering <b style='color: forestgreen;'>tangible rewards</b> like a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bonus or recognition</b> can help complete the task without undermining <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intrinsic motivation</b>. To use extrinsic rewards effectively, managers should also offer a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rationale</b> for the task, acknowledge its <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mundane nature</b>, and give employees <b style='color: forestgreen;'>autonomy</b> in their methods.\n\nFor more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creative, non-routine tasks</b>, it's best to avoid traditional rewards and focus on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>understanding deeper motivation</b>. Such as when producing a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creative poster</b>, offering a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>monetary incentive</b> might restrict creativity. Instead, fostering a climate of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>autonomy, creative opportunity,</b> and a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sense of purpose</b> helps. When rewards are unavoidable, they should be <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unexpected</b> and occur <b style='color: forestgreen;'>after task completion</b> to avoid damaging intrinsic drive. Providing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>informative feedback</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>praise</b> as rewards can enhance motivation without the caveats of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>if-then rewards</b>."
