He sees two outcomes: the system superficially succeeds but dehumanizes society, or it <b style='color: forestgreen;'>collapses painfully</b>. Kaczynski calls for a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>revolution</b> to dismantle the industrial system, not governments, and identifies <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inferiority feelings</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>oversocialization</b> as key traits in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>modern leftism</b>, affecting movements like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>feminism</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>disability activism</b>."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Oversocialization</b> is when societal demands impose a severe burden on individuals, leading to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>low self-esteem</b> and feelings of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>powerlessness</b>. While appearing as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rebels</b>, oversocialized leftists actually align deeply with societal moral codes, simply critiquing society's failure to meet these standards. This leads them to support causes like racial equality and nonviolence, pushing to integrate marginalized groups into \"industrial-technological\" norms, while claiming to preserve cultural uniqueness superficially. Their true attachment to societal values often surfaces, revealing the constraints social expectations place on their autonomy and personal values.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Power Process</b> is essential for psychological well-being, involving <b style='color: forestgreen;'>setting goals, exerting effort</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>attaining goals</b>. Without real challenges, humans become demoralized. This \"power process\" is perverted in modern society through <b style='color: forestgreen;'>surrogate activities</b>\u2014pursuits like art, science, or human rights activism that serve as substitutes for tangible goals. These are often less satisfying as they don\u2019t fulfill a need for autonomous goal achievement. Ultimately, people engage in these activities not purely for their essence but as an escape from trivialized biological needs and societal conformity, striving for an elusive fulfillment that remains out of reach."

When people can't control their goals, they might feel <b style='color: forestgreen;'>frustrated</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>demoralized</b>. Modern society presents these issues significantly due to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>crowding</b>, rapid changes, and breakdown of community ties. Despite some historical societal changes, today's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social and psychological</b> issues are linked to insufficient engagement in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>power process</b>.\n\nModern <b style='color: forestgreen;'>technological society</b> hinders natural <b style='color: forestgreen;'>human drives</b> by creating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>artificial needs</b> instead. While physical needs are easily met, other needs require effort, sometimes leading to feelings of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>purposelessness</b>. Many people feel frustrated due to lack of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>autonomy</b> in their work and daily lives, relying largely on what the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>system</b> provides.

Meanwhile, in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>primitive societies</b>, life progresses through stages naturally, with real goals like hunting and raising a family leading to a fulfilling life.

Those in power justify restrictions as necessary for protecting the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social machine</b>. A system imposes limitations due to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>technological needs</b>, not truly addressing human well-being. Even reforms or societal revolution face challenges because they either accelerate existing trends or fall back to old patterns due to society's complex nature. The American Revolution isn't an exception but instead illustrates how changes align with an ongoing trajectory rather than altering society fundamentally.\n\nMaintaining <b style='color: forestgreen;'>freedom</b> amidst <b style='color: forestgreen;'>technological advances</b> is improbable; radical changes disrupting societal norms are needed but are risky and unpredictable. As such, the system makes people conform to technology by influencing behavior and restricting personal impact on major decisions. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Locally autonomous</b> communities are less feasible because of dependence on large systems and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interconnected consequences</b> of technology. Ultimately, the system prioritizes its needs, not those of individuals, and creates <b style='color: forestgreen;'>propaganda</b> to align behaviors with its demands."
