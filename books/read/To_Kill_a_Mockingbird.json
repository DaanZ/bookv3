Despite <b style='color: forestgreen;'>warnings</b> that the Cuban government was capable of attacking U.S. planes, the warnings were ignored until chaos ensued. Brown, who worked in military counterintelligence, suspected that the Cubans orchestrated this crisis to make America look incompetent. With a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>spy</b> inside Hermanos al Rescate and a scheduled warning from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Ana Montes</b>, a prominent DIA analyst, Brown saw too many red flags.\n\nBrown's suspicions centered on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Ana Montes</b> because she was the one who arranged the meeting with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Admiral Eugene Carroll</b> the day before the shooting. Montes left the crisis room abruptly, contrary to protocol, which was suspicious. When Brown shared his concerns with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Scott Carmichael</b>, he felt the coincidences connected <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Montes</b> to a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Cuban influence operation</b>. Carmichael initially dismissed Brown's musings because Montes excelled in her job and had no personal red flags.\n\nAmidst these complications was the context of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Cuban espionage</b>, including <b style='color: forestgreen;'>defectors</b> claiming a significant spy existed within the U.S. military intelligence. Brown believed Montes's abrupt departure during a critical crisis was an indication of espionage. Though paranoid, Carmichael eventually took Brown's claims seriously, recognizing the gravity behind what initially seemed like a speculative conversation."
