By examining these formations, we can begin to predict future events or changes. This field of study involves various disciplines such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mathematics</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>biology</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>physics</b>, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding.

For example, pages 5 and 7 use addition in explanations, whereas page 11 involves multiplication by 4.
