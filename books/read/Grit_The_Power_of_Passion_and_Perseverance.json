            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>David Luong</b>, a dedicated student from a regular math track in Lowell, displayed remarkable work ethic and excelled despite not being in the accelerated class. Recognizing his potential, his teacher facilitated his transfer to a more advanced class, where <b style='color: forestgreen;'>David faced challenges but persevered</b>, ultimately graduating from Swarthmore College with dual degrees and earning a PhD in mechanical engineering. His story illustrates that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dedication and effort</b> can outweigh initial placement or perceived talent.<br><br>The narrative segues into a broader examination of the importance of effort over inherent talent. It references historical perspectives, with psychologist <b style='color: forestgreen;'>William James</b> and sociologist <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Francis Galton</b> highlighting the significance of effort over talent in achieving success. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Charles Darwin</b>, too, is cited for attributing success more to zeal and hard work than sheer intellect, emphasizing that high achievers excel through <b style='color: forestgreen;'>persistent effort and keen observation</b> rather than innate ability.<br><br>Angela Duckworth, the author, argues that society tends to overvalue natural talent while often overlooking hard work and perseverance. She presents research by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Chia-Jung Tsay</b> on biases favoring \"naturals\" over \"strivers\" in fields like music and entrepreneurship, despite experts claiming effort is crucial. Duckworth suggests this bias can hinder recognizing the true potential in those who initially seem less talented. Her own journey, which challenged initial assumptions about innate talent, reinforces the value of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>grit and sustained effort</b> in achieving success."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>David Luong</b>, a hard-working student, initially placed in a regular math class due to not scoring high enough on the placement exam, ultimately succeeded by leveraging his dedication and perseverance. Through consistent effort and determination, he transitioned to the accelerated math track and later excelled in calculus, earning a perfect score on his AP exam. His journey continued with earning dual degrees in engineering and economics at Swarthmore College and a PhD in mechanical engineering from UCLA, ultimately leading to a career as a successful engineer. \n\nThe narrative highlights the impact of hard work over innate talent, drawing from historical and contemporary perspectives, including studies by Francis Galton, Charles Darwin, and psychologists like William James. These figures emphasized the role of zeal and effort in attaining high achievement, sometimes even more than natural talent. Their insights challenge the common inclination to prioritize talent over hard work, noting that consistent effort often bridges the gap between potential and success. \n\nUsing the example of David and additional research by Chia-Jung Tsay, the text explores societal biases favoring \"natural\" talent over \"strivers.\" While effort is recognized as vital, unconscious biases still lean towards innate ability being more valuable. These stories and studies underline the importance of recognizing effort's critical role and questioning assumptions that elevate talent above perseverance."

First, it discusses the balance of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>talent</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>effort</b>, pointing out that consistent hard work develops skills and leads to achievement beyond natural talent alone. Grit is about having <b style='color: forestgreen;'>passion</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>perseverance</b> for long-term goals, rather than quick bursts of enthusiasm."

            "body": "Height, like many traits, is influenced both by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>genetics</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>environment</b>. While average human height has significantly increased over generations\u2014thanks to improved nutrition and health\u2014it isn't purely due to genetic changes. Similarly, characteristics like \n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>honesty</b>, talent, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>grit</b> are shaped by our DNA but also heavily influenced by our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>experiences</b>. While some genes may help in learning simpler skills, development also largely depends on the opportunities and experiences encountered throughout life.\n\nUsing the example of swimming, we see how both innate ability and proper training play crucial roles. Sociologist Dan Chambliss shared his story of struggling with certain strokes due to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>physical constraints</b>, but also pointed out that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bad coaching</b> affected his early swimming potential. This illustrates how environment, such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>quality guidance</b>, can profoundly affect skill mastery.\n\nLastly, studies on twins indicate that traits like grit have <b style='color: forestgreen;'>genetic components</b> but are not determined by one gene. A research conducted on twins estimated grit to be heritable in certain aspects. However, many genes contribute collectively to any trait. Heritability explains variation among individuals, but does not account for changes across populations, as seen in the Flynn effect, where technological advancements have led to increased scores in intelligence tests over decades."

While both Steve Young and Francesca Martinez exemplify these parenting strategies, it's noted that other <b style='color: forestgreen;'>role models</b>, beyond immediate parents, also play a significant role in cultivating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>grit</b>, indicating the broader influence of communal adult figures in a child's development.<br><br>The description of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>parenting styles</b> reveals that children raised in an environment that is both <b style='color: forestgreen;'>demanding</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>supportive</b> tend to outperform their peers. This is because they internalize their parents' <b style='color: forestgreen;'>values</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>work ethics</b>, often seeing them as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>role models</b>. For example, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Steve Young</b>'s grit was nurtured by parents who pushed him to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>persevere</b> but also provided emotional support, while Francesca Martinez was encouraged to follow her <b style='color: forestgreen;'>passions</b> with parental guidance that emphasized both <b style='color: forestgreen;'>freedom</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>discipline</b>.<br><br>Overall, the intersection of supportive and high-standard parenting is pivotal for the development of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>grit</b>. This applies not only in parental contexts but also extends to other influential adult figures within a child's life. The takeaway is that both parental and broader <b style='color: forestgreen;'>societal influences</b> are crucial in enabling children, and eventually adults, to develop lasting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>passion</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>perseverance</b> for long-term goals."

This support helped him excel and eventually establish a successful company, Shopify. Similarly, research underscores that supportive and demanding educators significantly bolster students' academic and personal growth. Studies, like those led by economists like Ron Ferguson and psychologists David Yeager and Geoff Cohen, demonstrate that a teacher's encouragement and high expectations can dramatically influence student motivation and achievement.\n\nCody Coleman, despite a difficult background, was motivated by his brother and a devoted teacher, leading him to excel academically and aim high. He pursued activities he loved, supported by a culture that valued effort and perseverance over innate talent. This narrative reflects the findings of psychologists like Warren Willingham, who highlight the long-term benefits of sustained engagement in extracurricular activities, which predict success beyond what traditional metrics might indicate.\n\nPrograms that emphasize both opportunities for such engagement and supportive environments, like the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone led by Geoffrey Canada, are crucial. Canada argues that providing the experiences richer children have naturally, in a nurturing setting, can significantly impact children's futures. The importance of a community of supportive peers and mentors helps not only with skill development but also with creating lasting, impactful cultural and emotional growth."

He highlights that competition is not about outlasting others but striving together for personal excellence. Anson Dorrance employs methods like literary memorization and beep tests to inculcate grit, ensuring players understand and live core values that drive sports excellence. \n\nSimilarly, this text transitions to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>West Point</b>, where a shift in culture under General Caslen has reduced attrition by focusing on developmental leadership. This model respects cadets and motivates them by fostering personal growth while maintaining high standards. This balance is achieved by \"leading from the front,\" where leaders run with cadets to help them meet physical demands, exemplifying the supportive yet challenging environment that helps develop grit.\n\nThe text concludes by examining how shared vision and perseverance contribute to creating gritty cultures, as demonstrated by the West Point training model and the Seahawks' practice philosophy. Drawing on examples from sports coaching and military training, it underscores the significance of supportive environments in cultivating grit, highlighting how consistency in principles, language, and actions bolster individual and team development."
