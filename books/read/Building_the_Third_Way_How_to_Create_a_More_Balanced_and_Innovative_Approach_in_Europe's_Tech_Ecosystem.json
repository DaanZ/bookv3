Rushing to hire can lead to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>filling roles</b> with candidates lacking the potential to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>scale</b>. Copying what works for big companies like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Netflix</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Amazon</b> may not be effective without tailoring to specific business goals. Scale-ups must aim for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>partnerships</b> across the organization for recruitment and development, not relying on limited HR resources. Building a strong <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sourcing</b> capability in HR is vital. \n\nAvoid dismissing investment in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>values</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>processes</b> as too \"corporate\", as these are necessary for avoiding chaos and inefficiency. A strong <b style='color: forestgreen;'>AAA team</b> is essential for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>startup growth</b>, with studies showing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>successful unicorns</b> hire 6 times more leaders post-funding than less successful companies. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Hiring, onboarding, and retaining</b> talent should take priority, avoiding \"leaky bucket\" scenarios where top talent leaves.

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>In successful scale-ups</b>, product management serves as a hub for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>customer value</b> rather than just a factory churning out new features. To achieve this, companies often use <b style='color: forestgreen;'>OKRs</b> (Objectives and Key Results) that align with their broader <b style='color: forestgreen;'>North Star metric</b>. During the startup phase, the focus is frequently on reaching a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>product-market fit</b> quickly, improving <b style='color: forestgreen;'>retention rates</b>. Once this has been achieved, the next step might be to invest in customer acquisition. Depending on the company's goals, attention might shift to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>monetization, internal efficiency</b>, or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>expansion</b> into new markets or segments, thereby driving <b style='color: forestgreen;'>product-led growth</b>.
