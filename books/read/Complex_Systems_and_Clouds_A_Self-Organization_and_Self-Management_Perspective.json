After years of research, only small systems showed success. Meanwhile, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cloud computing</b> emerged, with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>AWS offering services</b> from 2006. Cloud computing grew vastly, with many <b style='color: forestgreen;'>CSPs</b> joining. Despite their <b style='color: forestgreen;'>complexity</b>, cloud systems still use <b style='color: forestgreen;'>traditional management</b>. The book explores if true <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-organization</b> can be achieved in clouds. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Complex systems</b> are characterized by nondeterminism, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nonlinearity</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>emergence</b>. The initial chapters review these qualities and explore <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nature-inspired algorithms</b> like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>swarm intelligence</b>. Cyber-physical systems and managing their complexity is discussed. Later chapters focus on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cloud computing</b> and CRMs, examining <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-organization</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Big Data</b>. The book suggests that with fast processing speed, systems could potentially <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-manage</b> efficiently like natural systems have evolved over millions of years."

For the HB approach, coalition formation is heavily guided by server capacity, leading to fewer servers involved at high loads, reducing messages exchanged. However, in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>JST</b>, communication rises sharply under higher loads as coalitions respond to service requests, with most communication occurring at higher, more contended network levels (i.e., cell and WSC levels).
