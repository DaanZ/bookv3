This requires carefully defining the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>API value chain</b>. Key questions to ask include: who the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>API provider</b> is, who the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>target audience</b> is, and what <b style='color: forestgreen;'>business assets</b> are exposed. Understanding this helps create apps that deliver value to both end users and the business. Public APIs connect directly with users, while private APIs, used internally or by partners, help streamline internal processes and enhance relationships. Each type harnesses flexibility and efficiency to drive business success."

Thus, maintaining older functionalities while introducing new features requires delicate balancing. Versioning should be managed strategically, ideally keeping a stable and consistent core while updating only when necessary to avoid breaking client applications and maintaining developer trust. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Avoid frequent version changes</b>, as they can complicate the contract between API publisher and developer."

It can handle different API versions, data formats, and protocols.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'>Going Versionless</h3>\nWhile challenging, aiming for a versionless API can reduce maintenance and ensure stability. By designing APIs to be generic and adaptable, additions don't necessitate new versions."

Public APIs may need varying levels of support, such as web-only or 24/7 phone support. It's important to set up systems to monitor issues, notify responsible persons, and prioritize support requests. Good API documentation is crucial and should be easy to find and use, breaking into clear, approachable guides and deeper reference documentation.
