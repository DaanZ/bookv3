It describes insurance as a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>promise</b> provided in exchange for a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>premium</b>. However, the book highlights a common issue with how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>insurance companies</b> often fail to uphold this promise through tactics known as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"delay, deny, defend,\"</b> where they delay payments, deny valid claims, or defend aggressively in lawsuits. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>author</b> aims to establish the prevalence of this issue and encourage steps towards fair claim settlements."

In the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>1990s</b>, McKinsey redefined claims handling, targeting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>leakage</b> where more was paid than necessary, thus making claims a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>profit center</b> rather than just fair settlements.

Systems measure and evaluate adjusters based on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>compliance</b> and cost-saving outcomes. This systemic change pushes for profit-driven evaluations over individual claim assessments.

The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>anti-concurrent causation clause</b> complicated claims by excluding coverage if water damage occurred concurrent with wind. Litigation arose, with courts sometimes ruling against State Farm's perspective, demanding they pay for wind damage that could be proven even if there was concurrent flood damage. Despite evidence of wind damage, State Farm denied many claims citing lack of proof of exclusive wind damage, leading to numerous <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unsettled claims</b> and public frustration.\n\nState Farm attempted to critique their processes openly in response to public backlash. Despite some courts agreeing that anti-concurrent causation clauses were valid, this resulted in ambiguity and claims being denied in unclear cases, leaving policyholders uncompensated even when substantial wind damage evidence existed. Association between poor handling of Hurricane Katrina claims and past incidents, such as tornado damage claims in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Oklahoma</b>, showed patterns of manipulation by hiring engineering firms to reflect favorable outcomes for insurers. Critics argued these practices aimed to exploit loopholes, resulting in insurance companies benefitting while leaving policyholders at a disadvantage, affecting trust in insurance providers."
