His findings revealed unique personal <b style='color: forestgreen;'>meanings</b>, leading him to define life's meaning as connecting to something larger. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Psychological studies</b> show that meaning, not <b style='color: forestgreen;'>wealth</b> or happiness, influences lower suicide rates. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Tolstoy</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Camus</b> grappled with existential <b style='color: forestgreen;'>crises</b>, seeking meaning in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>faith</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>absurdism</b>, respectively, showcasing different solutions for a meaningful life.\n\nSocial scientists affirm that effort leads to value in life, akin to the \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>IKEA effect</b>.\" Real-life insights from people from different backgrounds underscore meaning tied to family, work, compassion, and purpose in hardship. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Children learning</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>adults struggling</b> with hardships show that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>effort</b> toward valuable projects leads to a meaningful existence, stressing that striving for life goals fosters significance and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-worth</b>."

These pillars are at the heart of many spiritual beliefs and offer meaning, whether religious or secular. Individuals can create these meaning sources by engaging in relationships, choosing purposeful careers, crafting personal narratives, and experiencing transcendence through activities or rituals. They help people find meaning throughout life's changes and across different environments.\n\nIn practicing these pillars, communities like Tangier Island exemplify a strong sense of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>belonging</b> and connection through relationships based on mutual support and shared experiences. Despite the island's isolation and economic challenges, the communal culture here thrives on participation in social events and shared life events which unify its residents, reinforcing the sense of belonging and meaning."
