The allure of nearby Caltech inspired his *curiosity about the brain*, leading him away from the *medical career* his father imagined for him. This chapter reveals how personal and professional influences mesh, emphasizing that *science isn\u2019t pursued in isolation*, but through *social experiences* and shared *curiosity*. Gazzaniga\u2019s journey reflects how *unexpected motivation* and *interpersonal connections* shape a scientific career."
