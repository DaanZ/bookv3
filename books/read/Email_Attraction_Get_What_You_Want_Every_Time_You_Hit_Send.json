Consider if the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>email</b> will get <b style='color: forestgreen;'>desired results</b> or just appease <b style='color: forestgreen;'>immediate feelings</b>. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Read aloud</b> to check if you'd say it face-to-face and get <b style='color: forestgreen;'>impartial advice</b> to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>avoid unnecessary conflict</b>.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Effective Communication Tips</b>: Consider the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>recipient's perspective</b>; think about their <b style='color: forestgreen;'>style and preferences</b>. Use the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>three Ws</b>: <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Who</b> you're writing to, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>What</b> you want, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Why</b> they should care. Create a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>two-way conversation</b> to engage your reader and avoid being a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"party bore\"</b>. Use <b style='color: forestgreen;'>clear</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>engaging</b> language rather than stiff language to connect."

Just like we judge food <b style='color: forestgreen;'>visually</b>, readers judge emails by how they look at first glance. A messy email is like a greying steak; unappealing and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>forgettable</b>. To make emails attractive, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>create</b> spaces and make them <b style='color: forestgreen;'>easy</b> to read with short <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sentences</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>paragraphs</b>. This attracts readers and helps them focus on your important message.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'>The Power of White Space in Emails</h3>\n\nJust like a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cavernous lobby</b>, white space in your emails creates a sense of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>calm</b> and importance. Too many words create chaos and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>overwhelm</b> - it feels like climbing a \"word wall.\" <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Short</b> sentences and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>generous</b> spacing make messages <b style='color: forestgreen;'>clear</b> and leave room for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>important</b> information.

The text provides examples of common mistakes, like being too vague or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>overwhelming</b> with multiple requests, and offers solutions on how to improve them.

Apply the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>HEC Hamburger</b> technique with a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hook</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>explanation</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>CTA</b>.
