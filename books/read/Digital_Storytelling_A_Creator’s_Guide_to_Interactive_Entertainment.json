This form of storytelling has roots as far back as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>prehistoric times</b>, with traditions like religious <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rituals</b> turning stories into <b style='color: forestgreen;'>immersive experiences</b>. In contrast to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>linear storytelling</b>, like novels and movies, interactive storytelling allows for nonlinear progression, which means participants can choose their own paths and outcomes. Examples of interactive stories include digital <b style='color: forestgreen;'>role-playing games</b> and massively multiplayer online games (<b style='color: forestgreen;'>MMOGs</b>), which have gained popularity alongside advancements in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>digital technology</b>.

Unlike in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>linear stories</b>, where characters can be gradually <b style='color: forestgreen;'>built up</b>, in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interactive media</b>, it's harder to ensure a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>consistent buildup</b> due to the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>non-linear nature</b>.
