In today's world of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>abundance</b>, it's easy to overconsume dopamine-inducing activities, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social media or substances</b>. Key insights from neuroscience suggest that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>pleasure and pain</b> occur in the same brain region and work like a balance. This book aims to help manage <b style='color: forestgreen;'>compulsive behaviors</b> by combining scientific insights with stories of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>addiction recovery</b>, offering practical solutions for finding balance in a world driven by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>consumption</b>."

Electronic cigarettes quickly deliver high levels of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nicotine</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cannabis</b> today is way stronger than in past decades. The accessibility and variety of consumption forms, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>edibles</b>, amplify the usage. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Food</b> is also manipulated to trigger the pleasure centers in our brain with added <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sugar, salt, and fat</b>, making overconsumption common even with ordinary food items like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>potato chips</b>.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'>The Norm of Polypharmacy</h3>\n\nPolypharmacy, or using multiple drugs together, is becoming common. An example is a patient who began at age seventeen with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>alcohol</b> and eventually switched to numerous drugs like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>OxyContin</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>heroin</b> over more than a decade. Modern society is hyper-connected not just in terms of access to chemical drugs but also <b style='color: forestgreen;'>digital drugs</b> like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>pornography</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>gambling</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>video games</b>\u2014creating a digital drug phenomenon that features <b style='color: forestgreen;'>exponential potency</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>availability</b>.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'>Indulgence in the Digital Age</h3>\n\nThe act of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>buying</b> has evolved into a drug itself; people like Chi get high from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>shopping online</b>, enjoying the anticipation and acquisition phases. Despite financial <b style='color: forestgreen;'>debt</b>, they continue the compulsive cycle of ordering and returning <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cheap goods</b>. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>internet</b> promotes compulsive behaviors by offering increased access and the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>suggestion</b> of actions one might otherwise never consider. These seemingly benign acts can foster <b style='color: forestgreen;'>addictive cycles</b>, pushing individuals, wittingly or not, toward overconsumption."
