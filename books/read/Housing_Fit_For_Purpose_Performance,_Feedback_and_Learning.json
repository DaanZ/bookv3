Early laws aimed to prevent housing-related diseases, but lacked insights into <b style='color: forestgreen;'>actual performance</b>. By the 19th century's end, reformers like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Octavia Hill</b> associated housing quality with occupant behavior, a link that persists today, connecting well-being and dwelling conditions. Post-WWII, modernism spurred interest in healthier design, but lacked comprehensive evaluation methods.

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Housing evaluation</b> has evolved over time, influenced by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>energy crises</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>climate change</b>. Initially, housing surveys in the UK were limited to structure and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>basic amenities</b>, with little input from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inhabitants</b>. Progress was made with the inclusion of surveys like the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>English House Condition Survey</b> in 1967 and later studies that evaluated more broadly, including <b style='color: forestgreen;'>environmental</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>behavioural</b> aspects. However, earlier <b style='color: forestgreen;'>monitoring efforts</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>performance evaluations</b> often lacked depth or integration with inhabitants' experiences, necessitating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interdisciplinary collaboration</b> between social sciences and building sciences to create more comprehensive evaluations.\n\nThe introduction of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>building performance evaluation (BPE)</b> aimed to close gaps between designed and actual performance by including occupant experience and environmental impact, such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>energy use</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>emissions</b>. Yet challenges persist due to institutional reluctance and regulatory limitations. Evolving concepts, such as the integration of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social interaction with environmental dynamics</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sustainability standards</b> like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Passivhaus</b>, aim to drive improved housing performance. However, real-world applications of BPE are hampered by disparate regulations and inconsistent metrics across regions and disciplines, underlining the vital need for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>feedback loops</b> that include detailed occupant input to address <b style='color: forestgreen;'>performance deviations</b>."
