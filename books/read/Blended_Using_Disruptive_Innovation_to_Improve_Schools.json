            "body": "Schools are at a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>tipping point</b> as online learning is becoming more prevalent. Predictions from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Disrupting Class</b> in 2008 stated that by 2019, 50% of high school courses would utilize online learning. This prediction seems <b style='color: forestgreen;'>accurate</b> today. The key question is whether this shift towards online education is good, and how to make it beneficial for learning. Online learning is seen as a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>disruptive innovation</b>, changing traditional education systems similarly to how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>TurboTax</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>email</b> have changed other industries. These innovations initially offer <b style='color: forestgreen;'>affordable</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>accessible</b> alternatives for those without resources but often improve over time, providing higher quality services.\n\nOnline learning in schools started with \u201c<b style='color: forestgreen;'>nonconsumption</b>\u201d areas where traditional options were unavailable, such as advanced courses in rural schools and for credit recovery. Over time, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>online learning</b> has improved and is now integrated into traditional schooling through <b style='color: forestgreen;'>blended learning</b>, which combines online education with face-to-face learning. This integration allows for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>personalized</b> education experiences, as demonstrated by students like Jack, who excelled with the help of online tools. Blended learning can address the shortcomings of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>factory model</b> of education, which focuses on standardization rather than customization, by offering <b style='color: forestgreen;'>personalized</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>competency-based</b> approaches.\n\nAs blended learning grows, it addresses three major desires: <b style='color: forestgreen;'>personalization</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>access</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cost control</b>. Personalization helps students learn at their own pace, access removes geographic limitations, and cost control alleviates budget constraints. Online learning has shown potential, similar to how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>KIPP Empower</b> successfully used blended learning to maintain quality education despite budget cuts. To fully harness these benefits, schools must transition thoughtfully, designing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>student-centered</b> learning environments that utilize the strengths of online tools to create effective, adaptable education systems."

Schools must clearly define what they aim to achieve <b style='color: forestgreen;'>beyond mere gadget integration</b>\u2014such as boosting student outcomes, providing more opportunities, or improving cost effectiveness. Schools like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Quakertown Community School District</b> used blended learning to retain millions of dollars by creating a cyber academy to compete with external cyber charters. This illustrates the importance of setting solid objectives, rather than investing technology for its own sake.\n\nThere are <b style='color: forestgreen;'>four key types of teams</b> to consider when organizing for innovation, based on the level of problem or task complexity. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Functional teams</b> handle isolated improvements; they are best when the work can be managed within a single department. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Lightweight teams</b> are needed for predictable interdependencies that affect multiple departments. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Heavyweight teams</b> are required for major architectural changes where components must interact in new ways. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Autonomous teams</b> are crucial for disruptive innovation when the economic model of the new project doesn\u2019t align with the current business structure, necessitating a separate approach to operate successfully.\n\nAn example of how these team types differ can be seen in the automotive industry. Toyota uses functional teams for incremental product improvements but had used a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>heavyweight team</b> to develop the hybrid Prius. The most challenging ventures, like launching pure electric vehicles, would require <b style='color: forestgreen;'>autonomous teams</b>, showing how different organizational structures serve specific innovation needs."
