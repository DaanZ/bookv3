This hesitation to involve the police may have hindered the investigation and led to theories about Manson that seemed more elaborate than necessary. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Dennis Wilson</b> , known for his connection with Manson, faced personal threats, diving deeper into depression and addiction, leading to a tragic end. Despite <b style='color: forestgreen;'>the murder case</b> being the longest and costliest in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>California history</b> , it seemed that those close to Manson might have had information that could solve the case but chose to keep quiet out of fear or guilt. \n\nAs concerns about Melcher's involvement and the fear of repercussions unraveled, some of the individuals involved, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Rudi Altobelli</b> , struggled to comprehend the reality of their connections with Manson. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Altobelli</b>, the owner of the Cielo Drive house, interacted with Manson and the other players involved after the murders. He recounted being advised by his lawyer to remain silent, hinting at potential legal and personal dangers. Even so, the gravity of these decisions and the personal turmoil spoke to the complex emotional and legal landscape surrounding the murders. The unravelling connections, conflicting stories, and suspiciously omitted details left the truth about what truly led to the terror and violence fueled by Manson and his followers, hazed in mystery."

It helped keep his followers pliant, but unlike many in Haight, Manson pushed his followers to avoid <b style='color: forestgreen;'>speed</b>, keeping them away from another destructive drug. The deeper relationship between the Smiths and Manson during this transformative period is murky, with both parties likely playing down their associations post-murders.\n\nDavid Smith studied <b style='color: forestgreen;'>amphetamine addiction</b> and noticeably paralleled his rat experiments with the Haight populace. Manson, who avoided <b style='color: forestgreen;'>speed</b> but embraced <b style='color: forestgreen;'>LSD,</b> drew a following much like a dominant rat in Smith\u2019s studies. The Smiths were embroiled enough in Manson\u2019s life that they pondered their own <b style='color: forestgreen;'>naivety</b> or culpability. During trials post-murders, Bugliosi didn't highlight their possible <b style='color: forestgreen;'>insights</b> on Manson's manipulations.
