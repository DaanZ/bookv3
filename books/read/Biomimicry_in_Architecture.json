In <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nature</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>materials</b> are costly, so <b style='color: forestgreen;'>organisms</b> use <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ingenious shapes</b> like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hollow tubes</b> for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>strength</b>. Bamboo is an example: it is <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hollow</b> but uses <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nodes</b> as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>reinforcement</b>, allowing it to grow tall. This approach influences <b style='color: forestgreen;'>architectural design</b>, promoting structures with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>minimal materials</b> yet <b style='color: forestgreen;'>maximum strength</b>.
