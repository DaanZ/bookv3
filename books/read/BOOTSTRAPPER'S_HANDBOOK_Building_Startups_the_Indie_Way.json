If you solve your problem, chances are there are many others like you facing the same issue. This means you might have a potential business opportunity on your hands, as a business essentially translates to solving people's problems for money. Your solution can be a website, an app, or a physical service enhanced by technology.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'><b style='color: forestgreen;'>Your Problems Could Resonate with Many</b></h3>\nI developed <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Nomad List</b>, a platform aiding remote workers and travelers in finding new destinations, guided by my own experiences of traveling across Asia and the issues I faced. Initially, it was a personal spreadsheet with details about different cities. Accidentally making it editable led to users from around the world adding their data, showing that solutions for personal problems could impact thousands, confirming <b style='color: forestgreen;'>your niche problem might have a significant audience.</b> Always start by solving your issues because you're naturally an expert at them. Trying to tackle other people's problems without firsthand experience might not be effective as you won't know the intricacies involved."

Quick fixes and small updates are easier if you're not waiting on others. On the other hand, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>outsourcing</b> can slow you down when you rely on others for small fixes. Building yourself in early stages is advantageous, allowing for fast responses to issues and new features without the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>wait</b> and cost of reliance on external developers, especially in a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>competitive</b> market."

Many startups fear to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>charge</b> as they worry about scaring away users.

An example is the podcast app <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Overcast</b>, which remains free but prompts users to support its development without unlocking new features. This approach skips traditional sales tactics by simply asking users \"Do you like my work? Please support me!\", which works even in niche areas that can't generate enough profit otherwise.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Subscription Models:</b> Subscriptions provide continuous revenue, growing with user retention over time. They outperform single payments due to accumulating income with each renewal despite some \"churn\" (subscription cancellations). Though effective for businesses, consumers often forget to cancel unused subscriptions, leading to unexpected charges. Consider offering one-time lifetime memberships as well for those wary of recurring payments."
