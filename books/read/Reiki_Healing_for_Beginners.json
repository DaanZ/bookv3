It involves <b style='color: forestgreen;'>static hand positions</b> and energy symbols.

It can be <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stored</b> (like a stretched elastic band) or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>working</b> (like a flying airplane). <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Energy sources</b> are either <b style='color: forestgreen;'>renewable</b> (e.g., solar, wind, biomass) or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nonrenewable</b>.

            "body": "Albert <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Einstein</b> and Nikola <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Tesla</b> both studied <b style='color: forestgreen;'>energy</b>, a concept essential to many areas, including healing practices like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Reiki</b>. In physics, terms such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>vibration</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>frequency</b> describe how various energies manifest in the universe. Everything, from stars to humans, radiates different energy frequencies and signatures. This understanding forms the scientific basis behind <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Reiki Healing</b>, which aims to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>transform</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>balance</b> these energies within the human body to promote a state of overall health.\n\nThe history of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Reiki</b> traces back to Japan where Mikao <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Usui</b> is credited with its modern revival. He, along with other significant figures like Chujiro <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Hayashi</b> and Hawayo <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Takata</b>, propagated this energy healing technique globally. These practitioners emphasized learning through <b style='color: forestgreen;'>oral tradition</b>, which later evolved as teaching methods incorporated written materials to make Reiki more accessible. The practice's essence is to harness \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Universal Energy</b>\" to aid healing, acting scientifically on the energies' <b style='color: forestgreen;'>vibrations</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>frequencies</b> to enhance overall well-being."

It is a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>holistic</b> practice, targeting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>body</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mind</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>spirit</b>. Reiki is <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intuitive</b> and localizes on where the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>body needs it</b> most but isn't a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cure-all</b>.
