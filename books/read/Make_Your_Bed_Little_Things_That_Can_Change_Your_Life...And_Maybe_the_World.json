It has <b style='color: forestgreen;'>basic</b> rooms with just beds and closets. As the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>day</b> begins, the trainees are expected to start by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>making their beds</b> perfectly. Instructors inspect uniforms rigorously, checking for precise <b style='color: forestgreen;'>alignment</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cleanliness</b>. If standards are not met, trainees face physical <b style='color: forestgreen;'>consequences</b> like being made into a \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>sugar cookie,</b>\" which involves getting wet and covered in sand. Making the bed correctly is a small but important task that demonstrates <b style='color: forestgreen;'>discipline</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>attention to detail</b>.\n\nThroughout his <b style='color: forestgreen;'>career</b>, the author describes how making his bed became a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>constant</b> amidst <b style='color: forestgreen;'>chaos</b>. Even during major events like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>9/11</b> and his recovery from a parachute <b style='color: forestgreen;'>accident</b>, the act of making his bed symbolized a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>return</b> to normalcy and a way of claiming control over his day. In Iraq, even when sleeping on Army <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cots</b>, the ritual of tidying his sleeping area provided a sense of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>pride</b> and routine. These repeated <b style='color: forestgreen;'>actions</b> helped him and others handle the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hardships</b> of military life, teaching that while life can be <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unpredictable</b>, maintaining small disciplined habits can <b style='color: forestgreen;'>provide</b> strength and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>solace</b>."

Recovery seemed impossible, threatening my SEAL career due to the intense physical <b style='color: forestgreen;'>demands</b> and medical evaluations required.
