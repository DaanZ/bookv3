Through his <b style='color: forestgreen;'>personal</b> ritual of watching movies during painful medication injections, Ariely illustrates the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>struggle</b> of managing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>short-term</b> pain for long-term benefits, a familiar challenge for many. He explores how our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>irrational</b> behaviors, like choosing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>immediate</b> over long-term gratification, shape decisions in work and personal life, highlighting behavioral <b style='color: forestgreen;'>economics</b> as a way to understand and improve these <b style='color: forestgreen;'>choices</b>."
