It claims its historical success by advocating for scientific advancements and political reforms that aimed to remove <b style='color: forestgreen;'>arbitrary authority</b> and usher in an age of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>personal freedom</b>. This bright view, however, oversimplifies as liberalism fundamentally redefines earlier concepts of freedom, turning on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>individualism</b> and self-interest as central tenets. \n\nThe resultant <b style='color: forestgreen;'>voluntarism</b> in liberal philosophy inserts each person into a state of continuous <b style='color: forestgreen;'>choice</b> and independence\u2014even reevaluating family ties. According to Hobbes and later Locke, society is built on voluntary association, and institutions gain legitimacy from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>consent</b>. Even fundamental relationships like family are reconsidered in individualistic terms. Yet, this transformation has erased a once rich vein of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>community-oriented</b> virtues foundational to collective governance and peace, potentially leading to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>crisis</b> in managing individual liberty and societal <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fragmentation</b>."

Liberal defenders fail to acknowledge how ideology, not just policy, is the root cause of modern discontent, misconceiving it as individual issues solvable within the current framework. This signals that the current system is fundamentally flawed at a deeper level.\n\nThe author proposes three steps forward: acknowledge and build upon liberalism's achievements while abandoning its failed premises; move beyond the age of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ideology</b> to develop new cultural and economic practices; and develop a theory of politics and society that embraces justice and dignity while eschewing ideological excesses. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Postliberal</b> ideas should strive for a genuine realization of liberalism's original ideals of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>liberty, equality, and justice</b> without just replicating the mistakes of the past.
