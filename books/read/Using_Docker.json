Unlike VMs which virtualize hardware, containers share the host's kernel, making them <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lighter and more efficient</b>. The chapter highlights the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rise of Docker</b>, a platform that has rapidly popularized containerization by providing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ease of use</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>standards</b> for running containers. Docker enables developers to have consistent environments from development to production, promising to eliminate bugs due to environmental differences. This is transforming software development from traditional <b style='color: forestgreen;'>monolithic</b> systems to more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>portable, distributed architectures</b>, enabled by Docker's support of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>microservices architecture</b>."

Avoid setting this to a directory with many files to prevent unnecessary delays. Each command in a Dockerfile creates a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>new image layer</b>; these layers stack, where each layer represents the filesystem state after executing that command. Understanding this layered approach can help avoid surprises\u2014since each layer is static, long-lived processes won\u2019t persist to the next layer unless started from an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ENTRYPOINT</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>CMD</b> instruction."

First, we initialize a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Flask</b> <b style='color: forestgreen;'>application</b> in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Python</b>, creating routes to respond with \"Hello World!\" when accessed. To containerize this app, we write a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Dockerfile</b> that uses an official <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Python</b> base image, installs <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Flask</b>, sets the working directory, copies the app code into the container, and uses the `CMD` instruction to run our application. \n\nA useful tip in this workflow is bind-mounting the source code directory to the container. This allows for live editing of files without needing to rebuild and restart the container, simplifying the development process."

Automation can be set up so images rebuild from GitHub/BitBucket triggers. \n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Registry Alternatives</b>: Other hosting options exist, like `quay.io` for private repositories, and running your own Docker registry can be done easily with Docker\u2019s official image, addressing security by adding self-signed certificates."

Centralized logs become indispensable to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>debug</b> issues as containers may be <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ephemeral</b> and may not exist by the time an issue arises. Various tools for logging and monitoring have emerged, and we'll explore free and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>open-source</b> options, integrating them with the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>identidock</b> application to demonstrate scalability.\n\nThe provided <b style='color: forestgreen;'>GitHub</b> repository contains code examples, each version tagged for easy navigation. This approach helps understand the integration of logging and monitoring step-by-step, ensuring you can <b style='color: forestgreen;'>customize</b> the examples with your images should you choose. This guide offers practical steps to apply these concepts in real-world applications, catering specifically to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>containerized</b> environments."

This can separate different environments (e.g., development and production) without requiring code alterations. The example used here demonstrates how to use Docker Machine to provision two hosts and set up Redis and Identidock using ambassador containers as intermediaries. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Simplistic to use, ambassadors can be finely tuned</b>\u2014such as configuring environment variables to direct traffic to specific hosts\u2014though this method may become cumbersome with increased connections."

The REST API assists clients in accessing the store.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Networking</b> allows containers to discover services without manual input or code adaptation, best done in production. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Weave</b> is a solution that succeeds through encrypted communications and DNS service discovery, while <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Project Calico</b> covers network isolation. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Overlay</b> networking links containers cross-host using VXLAN tunnels. These solutions suit different scenarios with some offering features like encryption or firewall traversal for untrusted networks."

Some key security issues are <b style='color: forestgreen;'>kernel exploits</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>DoS attacks</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>container breakouts</b>. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Kernel exploits</b> can have a bigger impact because all containers share the same kernel; a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>DoS attack</b> could starve the system resources; and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>container breakouts</b> are when attackers move from a container to the host or other containers due to unchecked vulnerabilities.
