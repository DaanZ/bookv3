            "body": "The Rule of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>95/5</b> is all about smartly allocating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>95%</b> of your business expenses rigorously, leaving <b style='color: forestgreen;'>5%</b> for extravagant guest experiences that make a lasting impression. For instance, even a small detail like a uniquely designed spoon in a gelato cart can captivate guests, as seen when the museum director bought gelato for curators who all admired the spoons. This rule became pivotal at <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Eleven Madison Park</b>, where slightly less costly wines were paired with courses, saving budget to eventually surprise guests with a rare, expensive glass. This approach was successful in elevating guest satisfaction and making dining experiences unforgettable.\n\nAdopting the Rule of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>95/5</b> also involved managing staffing costs effectively at the restaurant. Regular staff expenses were controlled, but occasionally a significant amount was spent on team experiences, like a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>team-building retreat</b> or a lavish staff party. These splurges were made possible by saving wisely throughout the year. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Unreasonable Hospitality</b> initiative, for example, epitomized this rule when a spontaneous purchase of sleds offered a family a memorable experience in Central Park. This approach, learned from formative experiences, helped cultivate a culture where disciplined spending met creative, impactful guest engagement."
