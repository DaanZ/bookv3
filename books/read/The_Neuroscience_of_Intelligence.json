Although the term <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intelligence</b> is broad, IQ and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>g-factor</b> are often confused, leading to controversies. Tests like the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>IQ</b> capture diverse mental abilities. To make these concepts clearer, diagrams showing their relationships are helpful. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Savant</b> examples show incredible <b style='color: forestgreen;'>specific abilities</b> with little <b style='color: forestgreen;'>g-factor</b>, proving such abilities exist independently. While rare, the presence of both <b style='color: forestgreen;'>g</b> and independent factors varies among people. Equal <b style='color: forestgreen;'>potential</b> for learning is questioned. Measurement plays a critical role, and the next sections delve into how intelligence and IQ are measured and understood, addressing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>myths</b> in traditional intelligence tests and their alleged <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bias</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>meaninglessness</b>."

A significant part of the scientific community believes that both <b style='color: forestgreen;'>genetic</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>environmental factors</b> influence intelligence, but there are contrasting views on their relative contributions. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Historical perspectives</b>, such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Arthur Jensen's 1969</b> hypothesis suggesting a genetic role in intelligence differences, sparked intense <b style='color: forestgreen;'>controversy</b> and scrutiny, leading to a generation-long gap in intelligence research.

Structural MRI was key in ending debates by providing precise in vivo brain measurements, revealing a moderate correlation average of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>.33</b> (McDaniel, 2005) between brain volume and intelligence. However, questions still remained about whether specific brain regions were more related to intelligence and how development affects brain size.\n\nSubsequent research involved finer <b style='color: forestgreen;'>segmentation</b> of brain regions, using image-analysis methods to isolate <b style='color: forestgreen;'>regions of interest</b> (ROIs). Studies indicated that specific regions like the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>temporal lobes, hippocampus</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cerebellum</b> showed small yet significant correlations with IQ. These suggested the importance of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>regional analyses</b>, where different areas might <b style='color: forestgreen;'>relate differently</b> to intelligence.

The discussion highlights how neuroscience might eventually enhance our brain's capability by understanding brain mechanisms. However, many existing claims about increasing intelligence today are <b style='color: forestgreen;'>na\u00efve, wrong, or misrepresentations</b>. These claims often appear in respected scientific journals, not just on the internet. Understanding why these misleading claims persist is crucial, especially for those aiming to enhance their cognitive abilities or address cognitive disabilities in children. \n\nOne classical example discussed in this chapter is the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Mozart Effect</b>, based on a 1993 study claiming that listening to Mozart's music for 10 minutes could <b style='color: forestgreen;'>temporarily increase IQ</b> by eight points. This claim gained a lot of popularity but was eventually debunked after critical reviews and meta-analyses showed no significant effect on enhancing intelligence. The initial study involved college students performing spatial reasoning tasks after listening to music, which was flawed in various ways, such as measuring the tests wrongly, and lacked replication. This issue underlines the importance of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>independent replication</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>critical evidence evaluation</b> before accepting such dramatic claims about cognitive enhancement."
