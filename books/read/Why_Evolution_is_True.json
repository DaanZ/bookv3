However, there's a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>progression</b> seen in fossils revealing how birds evolved from reptiles, specifically theropods. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Archaeopteryx</b>, a transitional fossil dated to about 145 million years ago, holds both reptilian (teeth, long tail) and bird-like features (feathers).

            "body": "In this chapter, the existence of species clusters in nature is discussed, highlighting their distinction despite being different from one another. Darwin's quest to understand these \"mystery of mysteries\" led him to study various species and their distribution. However, Darwin didn't have a clear explanation for how these species emerged, emphasizing instead natural selection's role in shaping adaptations. The chapter points out that understanding how species diversify from a single ancestor is crucial to comprehending biodiversity itself.\n\nErnst Mayr's definition from 1942, known as the Biological Species Concept (BSC), clarifies the classification of species as groups that are reproductively isolated from others. This definition addresses issues faced by earlier classification methods, like the morphological species concept, which were unable to account for cryptic species or variations within groups. The BSC links species to being evolutionary communities, explaining how they diverge without interbreeding, and thus continue to evolve as separate entities. However, it poses challenges when dealing with extinct organisms or those reproducing asexually, prompting continued debate on what constitutes a species. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Species clusters</b> <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Darwin's adaptations</b> <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Biological Species Concept (BSC)</b> <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Reproductive isolation</b> <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Importance of biodiversity</b>"
