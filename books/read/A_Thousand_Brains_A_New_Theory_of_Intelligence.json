Instead of growing new distinct parts, the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>neocortex</b> expands by replicating a basic circuit over and over, a concept akin to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Darwin's evolution</b> theory. Mountcastle suggested that all regions of the neocortex are fundamentally the same, doing the same thing but connected differently\u2014leading to different functions like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>vision</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>language</b>.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Universal Algorithm</b>: Mountcastle theorized a universal <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cortical algorithm</b> responsible for all intelligent functions, focusing on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cortical columns</b>\u2014thin strands within the neocortex, stacked like pieces of thin spaghetti. These columns, further divided into <b style='color: forestgreen;'>minicolumns</b>, perform the same underlying function across all neocortical areas. This idea implies that varied cognitive abilities stem from the same computational process, casting the neocortex as a uniform system executing a single algorithm for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>perception</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intelligence</b>.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Mountcastle's Influence</b>: Despite some skepticism, Mountcastle's proposition remains a landmark in neuroscience. It offers a unified explanation for the neocortex's seemingly <b style='color: forestgreen;'>similar architecture</b> across diverse tasks and animal species. The debate continues as many neuroscientists seek to decode the cortical column's function, holding it as a crucial element in understanding human <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intelligence</b>.

This implies the existence of neurons representing object locations in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cortex</b>. Historically, theories on this were largely <b style='color: forestgreen;'>deductive</b>, with hints that older brain areas like the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>entorhinal cortex</b> could provide insights.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'>Evolution and Navigation</h3>\nIn evolutionary terms, animals developed surroundings-based reference frames for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>navigation</b> to improve survival, like knowing where food is. Early creatures like bacteria relied on simple environmental signals. More complex animals formed internal spatial maps, allowing them to navigate using neuron-created maps in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hippocampus</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>entorhinal cortex</b>. Mammals, including humans, have these systems for tracking environments, illustrating the importance of spatial perception.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'>Discovery of Place and Grid Cells</h3>\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>John O\u2019Keefe</b> and later the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Mosers</b> discovered the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>place cells</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>grid cells</b> which map environments in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hippocampus</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>entorhinal cortex</b> in mammals, respectively.

The notion called the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Thousand Brains Theory</b> explains that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>what we know</b> is a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>collection of models</b> spanning across columns in the cortex, which helps in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stability and consensus</b> in perception through a strategy called <b style='color: forestgreen;'>voting</b>. \n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Voting</b> amongst cortical columns allows for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>binding sensory inputs</b> into a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>singular perception</b> rather than engaging just one area of the brain, which is how the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>binding problem</b> is resolved.
