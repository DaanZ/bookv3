It positions addiction as a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>treatable</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>chronic medical condition</b> influenced by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>brain circuits</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>genetics</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>environment</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>life experiences</b>. Addiction is not associated with a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>moral failure</b>, but rather with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>compulsive</b> behaviors continued despite <b style='color: forestgreen;'>harmful consequences</b>. The text emphasizes that there is <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hope</b> for recovery, shedding light on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>empowering stories</b> of successful recoveries, like a former patient who achieved <b style='color: forestgreen;'>abstinence and stability</b>. By <b style='color: forestgreen;'>understanding</b> addiction beyond societal <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stigma</b>, supportive <b style='color: forestgreen;'>relationships</b> and effective <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interventions</b> can foster healing and recovery."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Words</b> have immense <b style='color: forestgreen;'>psychological power</b>. The language we use to talk about <b style='color: forestgreen;'>addiction</b> can either severely <b style='color: forestgreen;'>hinder</b> or greatly <b style='color: forestgreen;'>support</b> the recovery journey. Society often <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stigmatizes</b> those with addiction by focusing on outdated terminology like \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>substance abuse</b>,\" implying criminal intent rather than recognizing it as an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>illness</b>. Shifting our language to terms like \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>substance use disorder</b>\" helps to remove the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stigma</b> and provides a clearer understanding of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>addiction</b> as a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>biological disease</b>, not a moral failing. Medical professionals are encouraged to embrace this language shift to better communicate the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nature of addiction</b> with empathy and precision.\n\nRecognizing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>substance use</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>substance misuse</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>substance use disorder</b> as distinct from one another is essential. Not everyone who uses substances misuses them or develops a disorder. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Stigmatizing others</b> by labeling them as addicts fails to acknowledge the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>complex</b> biological and environmental factors at play. Encouraging <b style='color: forestgreen;'>people-first language</b> like \"person with addiction\" supports viewing individuals with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dignity</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>compassion</b>. Addiction's roots often lie in the individual's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>DNA</b>, which may predispose them to risk in ways similar to other <b style='color: forestgreen;'>chronic illnesses</b> such as diabetes or asthma. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Educating</b> both the public and healthcare professionals about these nuances is key to changing the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>narrative</b> around addiction."
