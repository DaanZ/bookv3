When you observe your emotions or thoughts without judgment, you create a mental space, allowing your <b style='color: forestgreen;'>brain</b> to remodel neural pathways and develop more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>helpful</b> responses to stress. This mindful approach leads to reduced <b style='color: forestgreen;'>anxiety</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>improved</b> nervous system regulation.\n\nTo achieve this <b style='color: forestgreen;'>shift</b>, practice pausing and reflecting during emotional challenges rather than immediately reacting. Over time, this practice of seeing \"beyond the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bone</b>,\" provides opportunities to respond differently, reducing the intensity of cravings or habitual responses. This method doesn't immediately eliminate the craving or emotional response, but helps in creating a gap, decoupling the relationship between triggers and reactions, ultimately manifesting new, healthier feelings and behaviors."
