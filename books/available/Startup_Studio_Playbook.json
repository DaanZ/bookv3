They <b style='color: forestgreen;'>provide resources</b> like funding, infrastructure, and experienced teams to develop multiple startups concurrently. This model allows them to quickly iterate, focus on creating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>valuable products</b>, and limit the effects of failure. With a large core team, studios can redistribute talent if projects don't succeed, thus maintaining expertise and reducing startup failure risks. The approach has become increasingly popular, with several successful <b style='color: forestgreen;'>exit stories</b>, such as Dollar Shave Club. For entrepreneurs, studios <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lower risks</b> and offer a supportive environment to turn ideas into businesses swiftly."

This is achieved through a \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>conveyor belt of innovations</b>\" approach, launching 10-15 new companies annually. TechnoSpark sells startups at any stage, allowing for increased flexibility and market opportunity exploration.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Specialization & Efficiency:</b> TechnoSpark builds <b style='color: forestgreen;'>product startups</b> (flexible electronics, robotics, etc.) and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>contract services</b> (design and engineering support) that act as infrastructure partners. Contract companies focus on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>CapEx investments</b> and short term profits, while product startups emphasize <b style='color: forestgreen;'>OpEx investments</b> and development reinvestment. This separation optimizes efficiency and results in hyperspecialization, with engineers focusing intensely on their specific tasks, enhancing rapid startup growth."
