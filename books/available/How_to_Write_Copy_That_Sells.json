These templates serve as guides to keeping the closing copy both compelling and straightforward, leveraging metaphors to simplify complex messages into relatable concepts. A transitional example is given to illustrate how to smoothly move from the sales copy into these five closing templates, reinforcing the benefits and reminding about guarantees to seal the decision."
