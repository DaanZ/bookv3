From <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Rachel Dolezal's</b> racial identity claims to schools avoiding the word \u201c<b style='color: forestgreen;'>girls</b>\" and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>James Bond</b> turning female, these absurdities signal a societal drift away from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>common sense</b>. The modern obsession with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"wokeness\"</b> reveals an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intolerant liberalism</b> that stifles <b style='color: forestgreen;'>free speech</b> and conversation. Morgan, a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-proclaimed liberal</b>, is critical of this shift and longs for genuine <b style='color: forestgreen;'>freedom and tolerance</b>, values he believes have been lost in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>illiberal liberalism</b> age."

Initially, the pandemic <b style='color: forestgreen;'>united people</b> by drawing focus towards family, community, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>essential workers</b> while sidelining <b style='color: forestgreen;'>'woke' culture</b>. However, the societal shift did not last; after events like George Floyd's killing, a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>'summer of madness'</b> ensued, marked by an explosion in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>illiberal liberalism</b> which the author saw as destructive. This led him to shelve his initial book idea on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>woke culture</b>, as the pandemic's drastic changes prompted him to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>reconsider</b> his thoughts and actions.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Impact of the Pandemic on Individuals</b>\n\nThe narrative takes readers through the author's experience as his status shifted from being a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>maligned figure</b> to being <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lauded</b> by those who once criticized him. He now records his observations in a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>diary format</b> to capture <b style='color: forestgreen;'>real-time changes</b>, illustrating how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>coronavirus</b> provided a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>'wake-up moment'</b> globally that must persevere. Despite some societal <b style='color: forestgreen;'>polarization</b>, the crisis forced reflection and adaptation across communities, revealing the necessity for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>more inclusive perspectives.</b>"
