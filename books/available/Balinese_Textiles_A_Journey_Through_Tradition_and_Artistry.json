            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Bali Textiles</b>: This book focuses on the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rich cultural tapestry</b> represented by textiles in Bali, exploring their <b style='color: forestgreen;'>manufacture</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>use</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>significance</b>. The authors were inspired by the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>living qualities</b> these fabrics adopt, extending beyond their material form, to embody cultural meanings. An <b style='color: forestgreen;'>important collection</b> at the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Basel Museum of Ethnography</b> serves as the foundation of this work, showcasing a wide range of textiles rather than just seeking antiquity or aesthetics. The authors draw upon their <b style='color: forestgreen;'>extensive research</b>, demonstrating textiles as a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cultural language</b> highlighting their <b style='color: forestgreen;'>socio-semiotic</b> significance in Balinese <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rituals</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>daily life</b>. This work aims to both document and preserve this intensive craft amid pressure from modern commercial influences, while celebrating Bali's ability to blend tradition with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>innovative creativity</b>."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Summary of the Textile Text</b>\n\nBali's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>textile</b> tradition is deeply intertwined with its <b style='color: forestgreen;'>culture</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>history</b>. From ancient times, cloth-making adapted as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>tourism</b> reshaped the island. Certain textiles like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>double ikat</b> had <b style='color: forestgreen;'>complicated techniques</b> and were historically rooted in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Bali's culture</b> and at times influenced by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>China</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>India</b>. Despite these influences, Balinese textiles evolved <b style='color: forestgreen;'>independently</b>, reflecting a rich <b style='color: forestgreen;'>diversity</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creativity</b> that depicts Bali's unique priorities. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Textiles</b> aren't just for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>decoration</b>; they hold specific <b style='color: forestgreen;'>functions</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>meanings</b> in Balinese society. \n\nThe <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Purana Bali</b> text suggests inhabitants initially didn't know rice cultivation or metalworking, highlighting historical transitions, such as using <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bark cloth</b> for attire before acquiring <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cotton</b> knowledge. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>gods</b> introduced weaving and dyeing techniques, making <b style='color: forestgreen;'>textiles</b> bearers of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>religious and social significance</b>. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Textile lamak</b>, for instance, serves a specific ceremonial role, particularly on <b style='color: forestgreen;'>temple festivals</b>, showing the deeply <b style='color: forestgreen;'>spiritual connection</b> Balinese society holds with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>textiles</b>."

            "body": "In a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Backstrap Loom</b>, the warp is stretched between a warp beam and the breast-cum-cloth beam, with the weaver controlling the tension by leaning forward or backward. This \nmethod requires great <b style='color: forestgreen;'>skill and strength</b>. Various elements like the *bamboo reed* for spacing and beating the *sword stick* for extending sheds are crucial. The songket process is unique due to the inclusion of \"nuduk,\" a specialized task that very few can perform, typically done by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Brahman women</b> and skilled weavers. Typically, the costly <b style='color: forestgreen;'>nuduk stage</b> is poorly compensated despite the vital role it plays in pattern programming."

These <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sacred textiles</b> are worn or used in rituals for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>transitional life phases</b> such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>birth</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>death services</b>. At the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Badung market</b> in Bali's capital, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Denpasar</b>, one can find a variety of these <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ritual accessories</b> including <b style='color: forestgreen;'>wangsul</b> and other <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sacred fabrics</b> distinct to the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Balinese tradition</b>. Depending on the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>colors and patterns</b>, these cloths serve various ceremonial roles, including adorning <b style='color: forestgreen;'>temple guardians</b> or dressing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>statues</b> for offerings. They are particularly important for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>high-caste families</b> who monopolize their production and have the longstanding <b style='color: forestgreen;'>knowledge</b> of their ritual application."

In this <b style='color: forestgreen;'>purification ceremony</b>, a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Brahman priest</b> purifies a child, previously manifested as divine, now making contact with the earth through a ritual. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Sacred cloths</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>wangsul</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bebali</b> are essential. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>child is replaced</b> during a ritual by a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>pumpkin, banana blossom</b>, or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cucumber</b> as a changeling surrounded by sacred objects to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>banish evil forces</b>. Holy water is involved in purifying these changeling objects, including rice as symbols of well-being. The real child subsequently undergoes a similar ritual involving a bebali cloth, signifying its new stage of life.\n\nAdditionally, the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>changeling ritual</b> involves a procession with sacred items, and once completed, the purified changeling, clothed in special fabrics\u2014often of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>asymmetrical stripes</b>, is honored similarly to the child. This symbolizes the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dual principles</b> in Balinese thought where growth comes from asymmetrically but complementarily aligned forces. Finally, after dispelling negativity with the changeling, the real child is ritually cleaned and dressed in bebali cloth before the priest and deity, marking this passage with a symbolic hair-cutting and water ceremony, representing a cleansing from life's impurities and misguidances."
