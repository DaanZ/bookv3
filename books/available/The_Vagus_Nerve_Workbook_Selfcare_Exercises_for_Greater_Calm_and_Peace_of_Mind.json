The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sympathetic system</b> triggers \"fight-or-flight\" for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>danger</b>. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dorsal vagal system</b> leads to \"freeze/shutdown\" when both fight and flight fail. Lastly, the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ventral vagal</b> (parasympathetic) response fosters <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social engagement</b> when we feel safe. This <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social system</b> enables us to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>connect</b> with others, essential for survival, enabling actions ranging from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>friend responses</b> to effective communication.\n\nSocial connection is important for mental health and can be challenging for those with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>trauma</b> or mental health issues due to distrust. Yet, everyone can foster these connections since we are innately built for it via our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>vagus nerve</b>. This nervous system state fosters <b style='color: forestgreen;'>trust, empathy</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>engagement</b>, and is achievable through awareness and practice. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ventral vagal pathway</b> helps in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social interactions</b> by providing us the biology to send and receive <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social cues</b> effectively."
