Rather than focusing on traditional legal or philosophical views, the author examines how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>freedom of speech</b> results from social systems. This <b style='color: forestgreen;'>introduction</b> suggests that free expression is essential for functioning <b style='color: forestgreen;'>democracies</b>, with the author's analysis inspired by the works of thinkers like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Emile Durkheim</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Jurgen Habermas</b>. Through examining changes in the laws, Melkonian highlights how complex societies naturally develop <b style='color: forestgreen;'>communication</b> systems, making <b style='color: forestgreen;'>freedom of speech</b> crucial."

            "body": "Freedom of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>speech</b> is a valued concept in democratic societies, yet it is not an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unrestricted</b> right. The book aims to reconcile philosophical arguments supporting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>freedom of speech</b> with real-world restrictions. While traditional philosophical justifications have focused on individual rights or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>society's</b> needs, this text proposes a sociological perspective to bridge the gap. Sociology can help explain the accepted limits of free speech, considering the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>roles</b> of society and individual rights. Enlisting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sociological theory</b> provides a framework to examine how society balances free speech with other concerns like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>privacy</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>defamation</b>."

This has resulted in an increasingly <b style='color: forestgreen;'>restrictive</b> interpretation of what is considered \"public\". Within universities, codes of conduct often <b style='color: forestgreen;'>limit</b> speech to maintain positive learning environments, which traditionally free speech theory does not justify but can be rationalized when <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sociological</b> principles are applied. Outside the U.S., where speech might not be guaranteed, these rights exist after considering <b style='color: forestgreen;'>legal</b> restraints, showing a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fluctuation</b> in freedom of speech across societies.

Criminal defamation, once common in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>libel cases</b>, has reduced due to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>societal changes</b>. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>abolition of criminal defamation</b> in places like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>England</b> and limited cases in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>US</b> reflect this shift. The changes also show how legal remedies have been moving towards <b style='color: forestgreen;'>civil</b> rather than <b style='color: forestgreen;'>criminal penalties</b>. \n\nThe chapter explores how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>punishments</b> like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>bodily correction</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>steep fines</b> were once common but are now rare. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>evolution</b> of laws shows a trend towards <b style='color: forestgreen;'>individual autonomy</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>organic solidarity</b> replacing older methods. Additionally, the role of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>internet</b> introduces a potential increase in <b style='color: forestgreen;'>criminal libel</b> reporting, yet overall prosecutions remain limited due to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>privacy</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>stalking laws</b> addressing similar issues."

Initially, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>criminal libel laws</b> demanded brutal punishment reflective of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mechanical solidarity</b>, where social cohesion was reinforced through repressive sanctions. As societies evolved into <b style='color: forestgreen;'>organic solidarity</b>, the shared values diminished, leading to civil litigation over <b style='color: forestgreen;'>defamation claims</b> where reputation restoration, not punishment, became paramount. Durkheim posited that such legal transitions align with social evolution, where <b style='color: forestgreen;'>greater division of labor</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>weakened collective conscience</b> reduced the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>impact of defamatory words</b> on societal layers. Thus, modern societies reflect this evolution, shifting the handling of defamation from criminal to civil paths.\n\nIn today's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>complex societies</b>, resurrecting criminal libel poses a contradiction to Durkheim's theory. Despite its appeal in controlling internet bloggers, such measures clash with the essence of socioeconomic evolution and freedom of expression. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Criminal law</b> thrives on societal consensus and collective values, which are no longer offended by defamation. Thus, making defamation a criminal matter, rather than civil, risks <b style='color: forestgreen;'>undermining the law</b> itself. This alignment with Durkheim stresses that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>modern legal frameworks</b> cater to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>private disputes</b> like defamation in civil terms, highlighting the theory's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>relevance</b> in contemporary <b style='color: forestgreen;'>freedom of speech</b> discourse, validating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sociological interpretations</b> in formulating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>legal transitions</b> from traditional legal systems."
