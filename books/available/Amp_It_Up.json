We envisioned a broader strategy with our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Data Cloud</b> in 2019, allowing better <b style='color: forestgreen;'>data federation</b> and overcoming <b style='color: forestgreen;'>legacy limitations</b>. Many customers had <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mixed workloads</b>, highlighting the value of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>concurrent operations</b>, spurring us to broaden our ambitions.\n\nThe next ambitious leap was creating a \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>data marketplace</b>\" for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>discovering</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>trading data</b> easily. It brought together <b style='color: forestgreen;'>supply and demand</b> for data, allowing companies to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>enrich</b> data efficiently.
