Many people view selling and ethics as contradictory. But Anthony introduces the concept \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>One-Up</b>\" to redefine this narrative. One-Up means having knowledge that benefits your client, rather than just aiming to boost personal gains. Through the story of standing at <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Basecamp 1 at Everest</b>, he demonstrates how crucial it is to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>trust the expertise</b> of someone who's been through a situation first-hand, compared to relying solely on academic knowledge. It's about fostering relationships where both parties grow and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>make informed, smart decisions</b>. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>One-Upness</b>, when applied ethically, positions <b style='color: forestgreen;'>*you as a guide</b>*, providing clients with insights they need, avoiding manipulative tendencies, and cultivating trust. In business, this ethos transcends traditional sales tactics, fostering real client success, which ultimately <b style='color: forestgreen;'>benefits everyone involved</b>."
