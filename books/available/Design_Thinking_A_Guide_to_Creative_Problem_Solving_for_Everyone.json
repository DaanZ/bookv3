This adaptability involves combining or altering steps such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>information gathering</b>, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>problem analysis</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>expression synthesis</b> in a way that best suits the unique context, stakeholders, and goals of each project. By being flexible, you encourage creativity, innovation, and unique solutions that resonate with the challenges faced. For instance, if the problem is well-understood, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>information gathering</b> might be shortened or omitted to focus resources on ideation and execution.\n\n<h3 style='color: forestgreen;'><b style='color: forestgreen;'>Dynamic Processes</b></h3>\nDesign thinking thrives through processes tailored to specific needs, merging different components like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>idea generation</b> with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>writing prototyping</b> into a seamless workflow. This fluid method rejects rigid compartmentalization, reflecting unique project demands and individual working styles. Processes can be varied and dynamic, such as when turned into an uninterrupted creative session with stakeholders, sometimes kickstarting with a strategic charrette. It emphasizes continuous brainstorming without rigid barriers, promoting efficient idea development and solution formulation, making the entire process as creative and innovative as the final product itself."
