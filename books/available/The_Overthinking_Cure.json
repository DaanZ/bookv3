Calm individuals are proactive, creating situations that align with their values, while reactive ones blame others or circumstances. To cultivate <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inner calm</b>, stop complaining and blaming, and take responsibility for your actions and attitudes. This <b style='color: forestgreen;'>focused flexibility</b> makes change less intimidating and helps you <b style='color: forestgreen;'>engage actively</b> with life. Avoid \"if only\" mindsets; instead, focus on what you can do <b style='color: forestgreen;'>here and now</b>."

            "body": "In creating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mental space</b>, we can step back from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>blame</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>complaints</b> to focus on what <b style='color: forestgreen;'>actions</b> we can take. When we realize what causes our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>anxiety</b>, we can write it down, acknowledge our feelings, and then explore possible options. Shifting focus to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>solutions</b> empowers us to become calmer and more proactive. By catching ourselves in passive thoughts like \"If only,\" we can instead explore <b style='color: forestgreen;'>concrete</b> actions to achieve our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>desires</b>. By tackling excuses and regrets head-on, they transform into beneficial actions, reducing anxiety.\n\nCreating a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>psychological distance</b> allows us to observe situations objectively, promoting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>calmness</b> and better control. Practicing this helps us see our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>thoughts</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>emotions</b> for what they are, separate from reality, which reduces anxiety and increases agency. Techniques like spatial changes help detach from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>engrossing</b> situations, providing a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>clearer perspective</b>. Additionally, using tools like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>journals</b> or imaginary advice can shift our perspective, making problems seem less dire. These methods enable <b style='color: forestgreen;'>mental flexibility</b>, allowing us to choose constructive actions aligning with our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>values</b>, instead of reactive ones driven by anxiety or emotions."

            "body": "This section explains how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>committed action</b> is more than just performing tasks, it's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>valued action</b> that aligns with what truly matters to you. By being guided by your <b style='color: forestgreen;'>values</b>, your actions become <b style='color: forestgreen;'>meaningful</b>. For instance, when dealing with a cancer diagnosis, staying informed rather than being led by fear is a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>proactive choice</b> that reflects responsibility for your health. Such actions signify <b style='color: forestgreen;'>empowerment</b>, as they stem from clear values over external control.\n\nFurthermore, the section touches on combating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rumination</b>\u2014when you overthink without solving problems. Unlike helpful, problem-solving thinking, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rumination</b> causes distress without benefit. To manage this, recognize it doesn\u2019t help and aim to shift your focus to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>valuable actions</b> instead. This is part of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), where after acknowledging a thought, you decide <b style='color: forestgreen;'>if it aligns with your values</b> before taking action."

It arises from <b style='color: forestgreen;'>non-acceptance</b> and creates <b style='color: forestgreen;'>anxiety</b>. Without <b style='color: forestgreen;'>awareness</b>, we often relate to our stories of past judgments rather than the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>moment</b>. Understanding ourselves and others without judgment is a path to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>calmness</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>acceptance</b> and makes us more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>compassionate</b>. Letting go of judgment changes our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>focus</b>, allowing us to appreciate reality <b style='color: forestgreen;'>as it is</b> rather than as it \"<b style='color: forestgreen;'>should</b> be,\" fostering more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>positive</b> internal and external interactions."

This dissolves judgment and emphasizes <b style='color: forestgreen;'>shared humanity</b>. By using inclusive language like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"and\"</b> instead of divisive words like \"but,\" we embrace both qualities without conflict. This approach lessens tension, anxiety, and promotes <b style='color: forestgreen;'>self-acceptance</b> by seeing everyone, including ourselves, as interconnected parts of a larger story."
