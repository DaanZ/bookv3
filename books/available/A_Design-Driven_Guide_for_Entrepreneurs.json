The role of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>strategic design</b> involves creating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>holistic</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>adaptive systems</b>, encouraging entrepreneurs to adopt <b style='color: forestgreen;'>systemic thinking</b> rather than focusing on discrete solutions.
