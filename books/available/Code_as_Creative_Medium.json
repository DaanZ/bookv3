            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Code as Creative Medium</b>, written by Golan Levin and Tega Brain, acts as a comprehensive guide for artists, designers, programmers, and educators interested in \nincorporating coding into artistic and design projects. With a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>focus</b> on combining <b style='color: forestgreen;'>art</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>technology</b>, this handbook addresses a gap in traditional coding education by emphasizing the \"why\" behind coding, dedicating itself to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creative exploration</b> rather than merely the technical \"how.\" It provides <b style='color: forestgreen;'>assignments</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>exercises</b> that can adapt to diverse learning styles and encourages innovation and thoughtfulness. The narrative also underscores the importance of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cultural impact</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>diversity</b> in creative coding. By drawing on decades of experience and a global community, the book offers a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unique approach</b> to teaching and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>rethinking</b> the use of computational tools in a creative context."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Code as Creative Medium</b> is a book designed to explore the intersection of coding and creativity. Even though it doesn't contain direct code samples, it offers <b style='color: forestgreen;'>assignments</b> aimed at integrating art and software while ensuring these tasks remain applicable across evolving technologies. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>online repository</b> complements the book by providing code to support learning. The book suggests that these assignments can be used in varied educational contexts\u2014from a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>kitchen table</b> to *university*. Its goal is to enrich one\u2019s experience between art and coding, offering <b style='color: forestgreen;'>lifelong learning</b> opportunities regardless of the platform used. \n\nThis approach ensures the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>relevance</b> of these exercises by no longer tying them to a specific programming language. The book beckons its audience to adapt and extend examples, promoting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>interactive learning</b>. Its mission is to stimulate creativity within computational art and push the boundaries beyond the established <b style='color: forestgreen;'>STEM fields</b>. By doing so, it hopes readers will explore the potential of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>artistic</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>technical</b> intersections through their unique journey."

The main aim is to show the unique features of your creation by producing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>three drawings</b> with it. Consider whether your <b style='color: forestgreen;'>system</b> enhances or questions drawing practices.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Learning Goals</b>: The task encourages exploring the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>drawing process</b>, evaluating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>creative tools</b>, and working with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>gesture data</b>. You can experiment in various ways, like letting <b style='color: forestgreen;'>drawings come to life</b>, creating a tool used by multiple people, or pushing physical boundaries like drawing without a flat surface. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>meaning</b> here is to spark creativity beyond standard tools like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Photoshop</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Illustrator</b> and to possibly challenge assumptions about drawing. Make your tool expressive rather than just functional."

The brief encourages exploration of how engaging gameplay can occur despite a simple control mechanism. Students are advised to brainstorm playful, meaningful games that do not require multiple inputs. This exercise serves to foster creativity and innovation by imposing constraints that compel students to rethink traditional game mechanics. \n\nThe <b style='color: forestgreen;'>learning objectives</b> involve understanding and applying fundamentals of game design while focusing on user interaction and experience. Students must consider how to convey richness and variety in gameplay using a limited control scheme. This assignment prompts instructors to let students explore <b style='color: forestgreen;'>variations</b> where they could adapt classic games to a one-button interface or create interactive stories needing minimal input. Overall, the task develops skills in creativity, user engagement, and problem-solving within software constraints."

This assigned task involves crafting and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>publishing</b> an extension that creatively alters or enhances one\u2019s internet experience, pushing boundaries of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>poetic or critical</b> web engagement.  \n\nTo develop students' understanding, the task encourages familiarizing first with web page <b style='color: forestgreen;'>structure</b> and browser <b style='color: forestgreen;'>APIs</b>, requiring hands-on experience in modifying websites or experimenting with simple interventions before creating full extensions. Extensions could leverage external <b style='color: forestgreen;'>data sources</b> or provide <b style='color: forestgreen;'>multiuser interactions</b>, requiring <b style='color: forestgreen;'>thorough understanding</b> of web technologies like WebSockets. This project will highlight the browser's role as a mediator between the user and the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>online world</b> and present a chance to creatively <b style='color: forestgreen;'>disrupt</b> or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>augment</b> this relationship for broader cultural or activist objectives. Critics of system norms like software studies scholars inspire such explorations into browser functionality and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>internet experience</b>.  \n\nAs browser extensions can extend cultural impact and raise awareness, they may also face <b style='color: forestgreen;'>restrictions</b> from platforms like the Chrome Web Store, which adhere to their business <b style='color: forestgreen;'>models</b>\u2014particularly those that challenge business interests or established standards."

This approach emphasizes <b style='color: forestgreen;'>system responsiveness</b> over the mere aesthetics of the output. The goal is to create a tool that\u2019s easy to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>understand</b> but hard to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>master</b>, allowing users to express and refine their creativity continuously. An awareness of how sound and visuals interact will guide the design for an optimal, creative experience."

Influenced by <b style='color: forestgreen;'>logical structures</b>, it's crucial for them to see programming from diverse perspectives. Educator <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Ph\u0153nix Perry</b> suggests integrating <b style='color: forestgreen;'>basic math</b> with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>visual output</b> as many students lack confidence in math.
