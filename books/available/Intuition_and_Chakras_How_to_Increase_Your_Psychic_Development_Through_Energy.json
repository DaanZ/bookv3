Many people mistakenly believe that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intuition is sporadic</b> and only happens in sudden flashes, or that it must make <b style='color: forestgreen;'>logical sense</b> when in fact, it is often <b style='color: forestgreen;'>subtle</b> and doesn't always align with our logical mind. Despite this, intuition is <b style='color: forestgreen;'>constantly active</b>, but external influences might sometimes dominate our attention.\n\nTo truly harness intuition, you need to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>quiet</b> these external influences and tune into your <b style='color: forestgreen;'>inner world</b>. This can be achieved by understanding your unique <b style='color: forestgreen;'>intuitive style</b> and consciously working to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>recognize</b> it when it arises. Intuition can sometimes be <b style='color: forestgreen;'>vague</b>, but with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>practice</b>, you can learn to access it whenever you want and use it to guide you beyond the confines of logic."

This ability can lead to being labeled as gifted or experiencing various unique skills such as musical or mathematical prodigies. Signs of abstract intuition include a passion for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>numbers, music, and art</b> or seeing the world in unique ways. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Nikola Tesla</b> exemplified this with his mental experiments, highlighting the potential of accessing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>answers effortlessly</b>.
