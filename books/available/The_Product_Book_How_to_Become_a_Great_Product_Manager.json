Whether you're a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>newcomer</b> or an <b style='color: forestgreen;'>experienced PM</b>, this <b style='color: forestgreen;'>end-to-end guide</b> helps understand the PM's role in building products and driving a company's success.

It highlights that PMs represent customers, saying '<b style='color: forestgreen;'>no</b>' to unnecessary features while collaborating with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>design</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>engineering</b> to build products efficiently. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Product School</b> offers further learning opportunities through flexible courses taught by industry experts."

Companies focus on how often users return to the product. Sustained engagement is more valuable than rapid growth but poor retention because it leads to a stable, growing user base over time. A good product becomes more essential to users as time passes, much like how frequent flyer points incentivize continuous travel on the same airline.</b> **Social networks are an ideal example, as users invest time in building their audience, discouraging them from switching platforms easily. On the contrary, products like ride-sharing apps can be easily replaced if competitors offer better incentives, due to lack of user loyalty incentives or significant differences in experience."
