Despite initial company confidence, key evidence and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>internal struggles</b> compromised their defense. A stark reminder of GE's <b style='color: forestgreen;'>internal corruption</b> is found in its <b style='color: forestgreen;'>contradicting explanations</b> for firing an executive involved in whistleblowing activities, suggesting possible <b style='color: forestgreen;'>retaliation</b> more than incompetence. This legal turmoil highlighted the depth of GE\u2019s <b style='color: forestgreen;'>challenging corporate governance</b> landscape.\n\nFurthermore, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>financial scandals</b> at Kidder, Peabody & Co., a GE unit, added to the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>debacle</b>. Mismanagement and suspected fraud led to a significant scandal under the watch of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Jack Welch</b>. The trials revealed industry practices and perhaps the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>ethical dilemmas</b> Welch himself faced - turmoil connected with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>misconduct and pressure for performance</b> at any cost in corporate America."
