We need to learn our heart is not a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>battlefield</b> but a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>garden</b>. Our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>emotions</b> should be embraced not fought, and our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>faith</b> plays a big part in healing. Dr. Anita shares her journey and how she learned the importance of embracing emotions. Many people struggle with emotional pain, often feeling defeated. Ignoring emotions or trying to control them does not work, leading to longer-lasting pain. This book provides guidance in accepting emotions and understanding their role in our lives."

            "body": "<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Valerie's challenges</b> began in childhood with horrifying hallucinations, falsely believed to be demonic. This led to deep fear and shared anxiety within the family. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>She turned to drugs</b> in her teens to escape, leading to addiction. Despite this tough path, Valerie found sobriety in her forties when she embraced her faith and love, and eventually succumbed to heart failure, an indirect result of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>untreated mental illness</b>. Early psychiatric intervention didn't help, as it felt foreign and sometimes condescending, highlighting the cultural disconnects in mental healthcare.\n\nThe <b style='color: forestgreen;'>narrative bridges faith and mental health</b>. The author, a mental health professional, reflects on the lack of community understanding of mental illness during Valerie's youth. She recalls her mother's insightful question - how to understand mental health through the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Bible</b>. This question sparked a pursuit to fuse <b style='color: forestgreen;'>faith with emotional wellness</b>. Recent events, like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>COVID-19</b>, have invited a dialogue between faith communities and mental health resources, recognizing the importance of addressing emotional suffering without compromising faith, encouraging discussions on avoidable divides, and nurturing an understanding that emotions aren't sinful."

Traumatized by the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>loss of her daughter in a house fire</b>, Maria was seen as powerful by others but felt disconnected from her emotions to maintain strength outwardly. Through therapy, she began <b style='color: forestgreen;'>embracing her feelings</b>, realizing tears were part of healing, not a loss of control. This mirrors how <b style='color: forestgreen;'>scripture ties emotions and the spirit</b>, suggesting that emotional acknowledgment leads to spiritual wholeness. For Maria, this <b style='color: forestgreen;'>emotional breakthrough</b> helped her redefine her understanding of being blessed, indicating progress in her healing journey.\n\nThe narrative further explores <b style='color: forestgreen;'>historical and cultural perspectives on emotions</b>, from Plato\u2019s dismissal of irrational passions to how these views infiltrated <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Christian theology</b>, fostering avoidance of emotions as sin-related. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Jesus exemplifies emotional expression</b>, illustrating that feelings do not undermine divine purpose but can catalyze spiritual power, a concept often misunderstood in religious practice. Unearthing emotional <b style='color: forestgreen;'>honesty as a spiritual tool</b> challenges misconceptions about emotional weakness, urging us to redefine <b style='color: forestgreen;'>strength as alignment with authentic feelings</b> in pursuit of a balanced spiritual life."

Goals should not be forced but rather <b style='color: forestgreen;'>grown</b>, requiring an understanding of internal barriers such as <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sadness, anger</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fear</b>. The need for a deeper inner reflection and tending to these emotions is necessary for achieving lasting change. The example of Casey shows that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>shame</b> and not lack of willpower can impede spiritual growth, signifying the need for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>emotional</b> work instead of sheer accountability.\n\nThe narrative of the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Garden of Eden</b> and its transition is used to illustrate how the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fall</b> has made life harder. The parable of the sower explores how three types of soil\u2014<b style='color: forestgreen;'>clay, sand,</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>silt</b>\u2014symbolize <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sadness, anger</b>, and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fear</b>, explaining how these emotions hinder growth. Sadness in clay, despite its richness, can overwhelm and erode belief. Anger in sand allows quick growth but lacks depth, leading to failure under stress. Silt, affected by fear, shows how life's uncertainties erode our <b style='color: forestgreen;'>love</b> and stability, like weeds overpowering a garden."
