In some cases, you might conduct a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>census</b> if the group is small enough, but usually, you'll use a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>sample</b>. Sampling lets you work with a smaller group that represents the larger population. <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Probability samples</b> are used in quantitative research when you want to generalize findings to a wider population. These involve techniques like <b style='color: forestgreen;'>random sampling</b>. On the other hand, <b style='color: forestgreen;'>purposive samples</b> are often used in qualitative research, focusing on specific groups to gain insights rather than generalizations. Examples include <b style='color: forestgreen;'>quota</b> and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>snowball sampling</b>.\n\nIt's important to consider both time and budget constraints when choosing a sampling method. For example, with <b style='color: forestgreen;'>cluster sampling</b>, a researcher might save resources by selecting geographically close schools for a study on detention rates. However, such methods require careful planning to ensure that the sample truly represents the population. The <b style='color: forestgreen;'>research methodology</b> and the specific <b style='color: forestgreen;'>research question</b> also guide the choice of sampling technique, ensuring that you can achieve your research objectives effectively."

Larger sample sizes tend to make results more <b style='color: forestgreen;'>accurate</b> in quantitative research, but are often limited by time and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>budget</b>. Allow for a higher sample to account for <b style='color: forestgreen;'>non-response</b>.
