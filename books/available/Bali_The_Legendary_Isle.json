This cooperative approach is vital for coordinating resources and ensuring bountiful rice harvests. In the evenings, Balinese women use the breeze to <b style='color: forestgreen;'>winnow rice</b>, separating husks from grains.

Performances are designed not only to entertain but also to pass on communal values and historical lessons, highlighting their importance in spiritual education."
