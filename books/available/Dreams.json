He engaged in what he called <b style='color: forestgreen;'>\"active imagination\"</b>, recording his explorations in the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Black Books</b>\u2014a dramatic form of thinking. During World War I, Jung viewed his <b style='color: forestgreen;'>fantasies</b> as forewarning the conflict, influencing the creation of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>Liber Novus</b>, a compilation of these fantasies and reflections. This laid a foundation for his subsequent works, converted into a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>contemporary psychological</b> language. His <b style='color: forestgreen;'>psychotherapy</b> work and the parallel <b style='color: forestgreen;'>alchemy symbolism</b> reflect this period of introspection. Jung's dreams, such as those recounted where he couldn't interpret them even with Freud's assistance, underscore his evolving recognition of <b style='color: forestgreen;'>dreams' importance</b> and their therapeutic power."

Dreams, like any mental process, can be analyzed since they involve a logical sequence or <b style='color: forestgreen;'>competition of tendencies</b>. While dreams often seem confusing, Freud suggests that they have a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>latent content</b> or deeper meaning hidden behind the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>manifest content</b>, which is composed of vivid yet seemingly unrelated images. He believes that everything we mentally experience has some <b style='color: forestgreen;'>underlying cause</b> and is shaped by our past experiences and psychological disposition.\n\nIn understanding dreams, Freud's method includes exploring the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>complexes</b> or emotional associations formed from emotionally intense memories, as these have a significant role in psychic development. Dreams usually express <b style='color: forestgreen;'>repressed wishes</b> or thoughts, which might not be consciously acknowledged due to their disturbing nature. For instance, dreams might replace challenging emotional topics with analogous symbols or ideas to make them more palatable, going through a mechanism known as the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>censor</b> to avoid direct recognition. This is why subjects cannot directly identify their thoughts from dreams without analysis, as those thoughts are typically repressed due to their discomforting nature."

Understanding whether to use a subjective or objective approach relies on whether the person in the dream holds real importance to the dreamer. \n\nA significant part of dream analysis involves recognizing <b style='color: forestgreen;'>projections</b>; we often project our psychology onto others, creating more or less imaginary relationships. Such projections can sometimes bring insight when we recognize that <b style='color: forestgreen;'>unconscious</b> contents color our perception of others. In a therapeutic or analytical setting, understanding these dynamics helps adjust attitudes.\n\nDreams also reflect the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>balance</b> between recognizing personal issues and <b style='color: forestgreen;'>projecting</b> them onto others.
