More than just money, compound interest applies to life: investing in daily <b style='color: forestgreen;'>small moments</b> with family and friends pays off in relationships. Take pictures, text often, and express love regularly.\n\n<b style='color: forestgreen;'>Feeling masculine</b> and achieving happiness takes different forms as you age. For some, it evolves from physical feats and social bonds to being a <b style='color: forestgreen;'>responsible and loving citizen</b>. Loneliness isn\u2019t about how strong you are; it\u2019s about <b style='color: forestgreen;'>social connections</b>.

He acknowledges the <b style='color: forestgreen;'>value of crying</b> for emotional release rather than suppressing feelings, seeing it as a way to acknowledge the beauty of live."
